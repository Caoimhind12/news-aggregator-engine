When he joined the modest, second-tier Dutch outfit Go Ahead Eagles, he told himself that he would only stay for two years at most. At the start of his second season at Go Ahead, there was one day when the long commute was especially inconvenient. His wife had to visit the hospital. Go Ahead had played a game the previous day too. The session would just be a light one. “It was only running training,” he tells The Independent. “I thought it wasn\'t important.” Kolder knocked on the door of his newly-appointed manager’s office and asked if, just this once, he could be excused. Erik ten Hag raised his finger. “Marnix, every training is important when you train with me.” Kolder would have to come in to work just like everybody else. “Then I knew what kind of trainer I was dealing with.” Back then, Ten Hag had only just started his first head coach job. He was a long way away from becoming the most coveted coach in European football and ‘strict’ is a word that comes up regularly when you speak to those who played under him during those early days.  “He was a serious trainer who knew how he wanted it but he wanted to keep control of everything, always wanted to be in control,\" says Kolder, who is still playing today at the age of 41 for Oud Zwart Wit in Groningen. There were no corners cut, no half yards, no inches given. “Even if we had to do runs in the woods,” recalls Sjoerd Overgoor, the fulcrum of Ten Hag’s Go Ahead midfield. Overgoor and his team-mates were told to complete a circuit through the local forest in two minutes flat. “To show him we were fit, we\'d try and do it in 1:50. He said: ‘No, if I say two minutes it\'s not 2:10 or 1:50. It\'s two minutes.” Ten Hag had brought his playing career to an end at Twente a decade earlier to take up a role overseeing the club’s academy, run jointly alongside Heracles Almelo. An impressive track record of youth development brought promotion to Twente’s first team coaching staff and a brief, season-long overlap with Steve McClaren the year before he won the Eredivisie. It was McClaren’s predecessor, Fred Rutten, who Ten Hag had worked closest with at Twente though, and he joined him at PSV Eindhoven in 2009. Despite only enjoying modest successes over the course of two and half seasons working under Rutten, Ten Hag’s reputation as one of the brightest young coaches in Dutch football grew. When he left PSV with Rutten before the end of the 2011-12 season, a number of second division clubs called. Go Ahead were his choice, and despite being his first head coach role, Ten Hag’s methods quickly began to convince his players that they were working with a talented manager.  “Behind every training session, there was an idea,” Kolder, Go Ahead’s captain at the time, says. “He makes every player better. Tactical, physical. Erik left nothing to chance. He was prepared for every opponent, down to the last detail.” “Every morning he\'d go to the pitch to see if the grass was high enough,” adds Overgoor, and this rigorous attention to detail was deliberate. It helped to inform a highly structured style of play that was all about replicating patterns, memorising movements and sweating the small stuff. One of Ten Hag’s regular sessions during his pre-season was similar to the ‘shadow play’ made famous by Arrigo Sacchi, except these 11 vs 0 games were played with a ball to practise and perfect attacking shape and movement. “It was really boring,” Overgoor admits, “but he\'d want us to focus and try every time, again and again and again.” Ten Hag started out with Go Ahead before moving to Bayern Munich II  Slowly, after many hours on the training ground, the rotations and repetitions became almost automatic. “When I had the ball, Marnix would know exactly what to do. The left-forward would know what to do. After a couple of months, we already knew: ‘Oh yeah, this is what we played 11 vs 0 for.’ We\'d see the way Erik wants us to play and we’d play like that.” Eventually, this would make in-game adjustments and responding to setbacks easier. “If we had a difficult time, maybe at half time, he\'d change something simple like: \'You have to play five metres more to the left and problem solved\'. It was so easy and we didn\'t see it. He\'d turn it around and in the second half we\'d be better than the opponent.” The actual style of play at Go Ahead was conditioned by the level of opposition and the “kick and rush” typical of the Dutch second division. Both Kolder and Overgoor can see differences in Ten Hag’s style then and now due to the greater technical quality of players at his disposal at Ajax but recognise a few core, progressive principles. “He believed that football wins,” says Kolder. “He wanted short passes. When the opponent pressed, then you played in the striker for a one against one. No long balls. It\'s really Ajax school, short passes over the grass.” These passes could never be straight or predictable though. “Always diagonal,” says Overgoor, “because then your body is more open. You\'d see more space. These were easy things but I\'d never thought about it. I\'d always ask for straight balls. But if I\'d run a little bit different, I\'d have an open body and see more space in front. These little details just made me play a lot easier.” It took time for some to adjust, though, and Ten Hag’s one and only season at Go Ahead was not a runaway success. Results were mixed and inconsistent as the players adapted to his methods and at no point during the regular season did they win more than two games back-to-back. There were times, early on, when Overgoor wondered if he was suited to the style. “In the first five or six weeks of pre-season I was thinking he hated me,” he says. “He was constantly shouting at me that I did something wrong, I had to do more of this, more of that.” It came to the point where he felt he had to sit down with his new manager to straighten out their differences. Ten Hag had recently replaced the door to his office, fitting a new one with a window. “My first thought was that he wanted to see everything, have everything under control,” he says, “but it was just to make it comfortable for us to step into his office.” Overgoor credits the subsequent conversation with fulfilling his ambition of being a top-flight player. “He said: “You\'re the type of player who is maybe satisfied with 80% of you but I\'m sure if I make you angry or more aggressive, that 80% will get to 100% or maybe 110%.\' Then every time he shouted, I knew I had to do more because he expected more from me,” he says. “If he hadn\'t changed my thinking, maybe I was just a second division player.” Ten Hag has enjoyed great success with Ajax  Go Ahead finished in sixth-place and qualifying for the play-offs was hardly an extraordinary feat - more than half the league did - but things had clicked by that late stage of the season. Three two-legged ties - one against top-flight VVV-Venlo - were won by an aggregate score of 13-4 sent Go Ahead back to the Eredivisie for the first time in 17 years. Kolder had long stopped worrying about his commute. “I\'d get in my car with pleasure,” he says. “Under Erik, I found out what it took to be serious about professional football. He gave me tools you need to win games and play good football, like responsibility and to always be prepared for everything.” He signed a new contract, extending his stay another two years. The only issue? Ten Hag would not be sticking around. “I called him twenty times to stay but he didn\'t,” Kolder adds. An opportunity to manage Bayern Munich II, arriving at Säbener Strasse the same summer as Pep Guardiola, was too good an opportunity to turn down even if it meant swapping top-flight Dutch football for the German fourth tier. After two years at Bayern and a season-and-a-half of helping Utrecht to punch above their weight, Ajax came calling. The run to the Champions League semi-finals in 2019 made Ten Hag known to even those with a casual interest in European football and his reputation has only grown in the years since, and much of the interest around Ajax’s last-16 tie against Benfica is around where he could manage next. “What\'s important for Erik I think is the people around him,” says Kolder. “The structure, the director, the assistant trainer. He works with the whole team and he has to have confidence and trust in them.”  “He has a path in his head and he\'s not distracted by anything and anyone,” Kolder adds. “Everyone has an opinion but he follows his own plan. That\'s Erik.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(23, '/sport/football/everton-dele-alli-frank-lampard-leicester-b2062173.html', 2, 'independent', 'Dele’s role in Everton rescue highlights decline and hints at revival', 'It was one of those moments that felt emblematic of decline. James Maddison was skipping past Dele Alli when Everton’s January signing chopped him down to collect a caution. Maddison has the irrepressibility Alli once possessed, the combination of cheek and talent to suggest the future belongs to him. Alli can seem the lost soul, desperately looking to revive his past. So far, so typical of Alli’s fortunes. In a tale of two English No. 10s, Maddison was the outstanding player at Goodison Park. Alli looked the afterthought, summoned for his first appearance in more than five weeks as much out of desperation as inspiration. When Frank Lampard sent for the cavalry, it consisted of him and Salomon Rondon. One substitute was indelibly associated with Rafa Benitez, and was belittled by a section of the Everton support as a result. The other was compared to Lampard because he outscored his now-manager at the same stages of their careers. But when Lampard was 26, he was voted Footballer of the Year. Alli’s first game as a 26-year-old began with a bit-part role for a relegation-threatened team. The mighty had fallen. Yet if Everton avert the steep drop into the Championship, they can reflect on an injury-time instant when Alli and Rondon combined and Richarlison scored. It was the first notable contribution of the Englishman’s Everton career. It was far from even his finest moment at Goodison Park – that remains a remarkable goal as a teenager for Tottenham, from a glorious Toby Alderweireld pass – let alone anything to suggest he is back to his best but, as Lampard said: “Hopefully it can be a big starting point.” Richarlison’s finish was deflected, perhaps Rondon’s assist was accidental and Alli’s role will not be recognised in official statistics but Lampard could reflect: “They made a big impact, they are both involved in the goal.” Alli’s part was more resourceful than brilliant, more perspiration than inspiration, but he made the run on the right flank and managed to dig out a cross. “Something happens for you, then you get your bit of luck,” Lampard reflected. “He deserves it, he ran into the corner, he gets the ball back into the box and we score off it.” It was a reminder that one of Alli’s great attributes was the ability to make things happen, that instinctive awareness of where to be and the innate swagger to shape events. It has deserted him in recent years; if his self-belief has felt diminished, so has others’ faith in him. Lampard brought him to Goodison but has never started him. Since a particularly lamentable cameo against Wolves, he had overlooked him. He turned to others, to Alex Iwobi to operate as the attacking midfield runner, to Anthony Gordon to play as a No. 10 against Newcastle, to Rondon when he required a goal at Burnley. Each was a role Alli would once have seemed the logical choice for. He remained an unused substitute when a fit-again Fabian Delph was parachuted back into the team. He seemed to be making up numbers on the bench in games when Lampard did not use his full complement of replacements. Perhaps, were Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Andros Townsend fit, Alli would have remained a spectator again. Instead, with Leicester leading, Lampard looked for a game-changer. His rationale was simple. “We needed a goal and he has trained well,” he said. “In the last two weeks Dele’s training has been absolutely spot-on.” Alli had been trapped in a footballing catch-22, needing match sharpness but not called upon when Everton needed someone sharp. “It is not easy when players are not playing regularly and you rely on their training levels to come in and affect things,” Lampard said. Alli had been ineffectual in earlier outings for Everton; in an instant, he turned affecter and a defeat became a draw. It may be transformative for Everton’s season and for him, but there have been false dawns in the past three years, games and moments that have offered hints of a renaissance under Jose Mourinho and Nuno Espirito Santo and Antonio Conte, but which became exceptions to the rule in an extended regression. Lampard was not getting carried away. “You have to work and fight through things with him,” he said. “We are in that process with him.” Alli has become a long-term project for a club with a short-term imperative to stay up. For the first time, Goodison seemed to have restorative powers for him on Wednesday. “I don’t think the story was ever going to be simple with Dele,” Lampard mused. “We all know how the last couple of seasons have looked and the high, high level of player he reached for a big period of time at Tottenham.” The Dele Alli story was once an uplifting tale, then a depressing read. Everton’s happy ending against Leicester at least offered a twist in the plot.

(24, '/sport/football/erik-ten-hag-manchester-united-b2062298.html', 2, 'independent', 'Erik ten Hag’s five point plan for success at Manchester United', 'Erik ten Hag has been appointed as Manchester United’s new permanent manager. The Ajax head coach becomes Old Trafford’s fifth permanent manager since the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson, succeeding Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and replacing interim Ralf Rangnick.  Ten Hag will see out the remainder of the season with Ajax, who he is hoping to lead to a third Eredivisie title in three years, before taking up the reins at United this summer ahead of the new campaign. The 52-year-old has established a reputation as one of European football’s most exciting coaches during his time in Amsterdam, having led Ajax to the Champions League semi-finals in 2019. Here, The Independent looks at what Ten Hag will need to do in order to make a success of one of the toughest jobs in football management... Harry Maguire had been a United player for all of five months when he was appointed as captain by Solskjaer midway through the 2019-20 campaign.  The squad was short of other genuine candidates – David de Gea and a 22-year-old Marcus Rashford were the only other regular starters with any sort of seniority in the dressing room – and Maguire’s ascension to wearing the armband passed off with little comment. That has all changed now. After a prolonged spell of inconsistent form, Maguire’s place and status as captain is fiercely debated outside the United dressing room. Whispers that it is also a point of contention among the players themselves have always been denied.  The squad has more senior figures – with Bruno Fernandes and Cristiano Ronaldo perhaps the most dominant personalities – and though ideally a dressing room would have several leaders, the armband is a meaningful signifier of importance and status. Ten Hag has a decision to make on the captaincy, even if it is to change nothing. It may be that Maguire is his skipper, it may be that a new captain is required as part of a wider reset.  Either way, that decision will need to be accepted across the board in order to bring the sideshow over Maguire’s status to an immediate end. A striker is United’s priority in the summer market given Edinson Cavani’s impending departure, with Benfica’s Darwin Nunez understood to be top of the list.  The arrival of a young, emerging talent like Nunez would raise the questions about Ronaldo, who would still expect to start and, tactically, has a greater gravitational pull than any other player at United. The assumption that Ronaldo, at 37 years old, would not fit into a Ten Hag system is not entirely fair. Ten Hag has switched between using false and traditional nines during his time in Amsterdam to good effect.  Even before Sebastian Haller arrived, Klaas Jan-Huntelaar provided a more traditional presence up top than Dusan Tadic. But Ronaldo’s pressing – or lack thereof – would likely be debated all over again if there were not immediate signs of adaptation and improvement. His numbers have risen under Rangnick but he remains among the bottom percentile of forwards in Europe for work out of possession.  Over the long term, Ronaldo’s limitations outside of goalscoring would probably need to be accounted for in other areas of the pitch. His limited playing time alongside a younger centre-forward would also need to be managed delicately.  Those will only be an issue if he is still at Old Trafford, though, and it remains to be seen whether missing out on Champions League football forces Ronaldo to rethink these final years of his career.  His departure from Juventus last summer was sudden, relatively unexpected, and driven by a desire to contend for honours right up until his eventual retirement. Time is of the essence for Ronaldo, yet United need a gradual, patient rebuild.  On the other hand, it is not entirely clear where he could go. The uncertainty over Ronaldo’s future could easily extend into the summer, meaning Ten Hag would need a plan for all eventualities. After Paul Pogba limped off the pitch barely 10 minutes into the Anfield humiliation, Rangnick was at a loss to explain why he was now without another first team regular due to injury. “This is now the seventh or eighth player missing with injury and we’re only playing in one competition,” he said. “It has to raise some questions.” Liverpool, meanwhile, are fighting on all fronts and could boast a clean bill of health. Rangnick is not the first United manager to raise this issue during the post-Ferguson era and even the man who is yet to take up the role is concerned. As reported by The Independent earlier this month, Ten Hag is understood to have reservations over the level of fitness among United’s players, believing that they have not been in “Champions League shape” for a while. United have had a total of 108 matchday absences due to injury this season, with the likes of Cavani, Paul Pogba and Raphael Varane spending the most time in the treatment room. Ten Hag cannot succeed without having key players regularly available. The Ajax head coach is known to prioritise fitness and sports science, and has earned a reputation for paying attention to detail in this department. “If we had to do runs in the woods, to show him we were fit, we’d try and do it in 1.50,” Sjoerd Overgoor, his former midfielder at Go Ahead Eagles revealed. “He said: ‘No, if I say two minutes it’s not 2.10 or 1.50. It’s two minutes.’” This may just about still be one of the most coveted jobs in world football but given how dysfunctional United have been for the best part of a decade, it is not one that any manager should accept unconditionally.  Talks between United, Ten Hag and his representatives regularly came back to his role in the wider structure of the club’s football operations and his influence on transfer policy.  The manager’s office at Old Trafford has a veto on potential signings alongside the recruitment department. That department is likely to see change this summer following the departures of chief scout Jim Lawlor and head of global scouting Marcel Bout. Ten Hag is eager to prevent United from making more mistakes in the market under his watch. To do that, new arrivals will have to fill targeted positions and be capable of playing his brand of fast-paced and fluid possession football.  There are gaping holes to fill if that vision is to be achieved. As well as the striker that is a priority, United require a holding midfielder or two who can progress the ball, a right-back who is capable at both ends of the pitch, a goalkeeper who is comfortable in possession and at least one centre-half who can excel in a high line in order to play Ten Hag’s style. Rangnick suggested after the Liverpool defeat that “six, seven, eight, maybe ten” players could arrive at Old Trafford in the summer as part of a squad rebuild.  That would be a busy and expensive summer, one that is difficult to pull off without the lure of Champions League football, and Rangnick’s words came with an important caveat: “Before you sign those players you need to be aware of how you want to play.” The scale and breadth of the problems which need to be solved at United cannot be underestimated, however, and the truth is that patience will probably be required.  Some of United’s many issues will immediately be within Ten Hag’s grasp, others will take longer to tackle, and a few are entirely outside of his sphere of influence. This is the hardest high-profile managerial role at the top of European football, with grand expectations on one side and real, challenging limitations on the other. More than anything else, Ten Hag will need to adapt. At least he is used to that from his time in Amsterdam. In an interview after guiding Ajax to the Eredivisie in his first full season in charge, he explained why he moved away from some of the club’s traditional principles – such as a nominal 4-3-3 system – upon taking the job.  “The qualities of the players determine the system, not the other way around,” he told Voetbal International. “It’s not even about systems. It’s about what you do in possession, when you lose possession and in those turn around moments, and you need to be able to change that up. Like I said, the players’ qualities determine how you play.” United’s squad is not especially well-adjusted to Ten Hag’s style, which means that Ten Hag’s United could well be a different proposition to his Ajax in the first season or two.

(25, '/sport/football/chelsea-lewis-hamilton-serena-williams-b2062272.html', 2, 'independent', 'Lewis Hamilton and Serena Williams join bid to buy Chelsea', 'Lewis Hamilton and Serena Williams are two of the high-profile sportspeople each committing “millions” of pounds towards one of the three bids to buy out Chelsea. The consortium they are reportedly involved with is that which is headed by former Liverpool chairman Sir Martin Broughton. The former British Airways chairman “believes his bid to buy Chelsea would offer the biggest immediate cash injection” into the club, PA news agency have reported. Lord Sebastian Coe is also backing Broughton’s bid with Crystal Palace co-owners Josh Harris and David Blitzer also heavily linked with joining, with the pair reportedly set for a controlling stake if successful. Sky News report that each of the two sports stars will pledge an estimated £10m to the cause, having both become “established investors” in different sporting areas in recent years. Against that bid comes opposition from Boston Celtics owner Steve Pagliuca and LA Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly, while a fourth option headed up by the Ricketts family is no longer in the running after withdrawing their bid. Hamilton, 37, is a seven-time Formula One world champion and is currently preparing for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix this weekend, where he will race with his team Mercedes. Williams, 40, has won 23 Grand Slam titles during her tennis career and was ranked WTA No1 for 319 weeks in total. A spokesperson for Formula One star Hamilton confirmed the 37-year-old’s involvement in Broughton’s bid. “We can confirm that Lewis has joined the Sir Martin Broughton bid,” a spokesperson for Hamilton told the PA news agency. Through Serena Ventures, her venture capital fund, Williams recently announced an investment in a British sports technology startup firm called Opensponsorship, which describes itself as an “influencer marketing agency platform”. Williams is also already an investor in Los Angeles’ Angel City FC, who play in the NWSL in the United States. League rules dictate Harris and Blitzer would need to offload their stake in Crystal Palace prior to becoming part owners in Chelsea, should the Broughton bid prove successful. Other investors reported to be involved in the consortium include the Rogers family, who own the $38bn market cap Canadian media company Rogers Communications, and the owners of two Taiwanese sports teams, the Tsai family. The club’s sale is being overseen by US bank Raine Group. Current owner Roman Abramovich cannot profit from Chelsea’s sale as a result of the sanctions placed on him by the government, but he had already vowed to write off the club’s £1.5billion debt. The club have been given a special licence to continue operating under restricted terms.

This year’s should be a close second by the same measure. Neither side can match their 2019 tallies in this Covid-affected campaign. Yet even if City and Liverpool finish a few points short of their totals from three years ago, the quality of their play is no worse for it. It may even be better. Witness the levels that both have reached over the past few months and you will conclude that four years of this rivalry - of each team raising the bar and forcing the other to clear it - has only improved them both. It has also done something more fundamental too, though. It has changed the nature of what it means to be in this kind of race. A decade or more ago, it would be possible to scan down a run-in and pick out where one team may slip up and where the other might allow them back in. Those at the very top of a league table were not expected to wipe the floor with those in the middle or even at the bottom. The points totals City and Liverpool now regularly post were deemed impossible. Nowadays, things could hardly be more different. It is no longer a matter of one team dropping points here and another there. Instead, with 12 games left to play between them, the task is to pick out the single, solitary draw that will cost one of the contenders everything. The one game where two points dropped will be mean the remarkable goes without reward. You could sense this vibe shift happening in real time at the Etihad during City’s 3-0 win over Brighton and Hove Albion on Wednesday night, right up until the breakthrough arrived by way of Riyad Mahrez at the start of the second half. Until then, there was a tension in the air and it was an entirely different tension to the one felt ten days earlier. In City’s previous home game, against Liverpool, anything felt possible. The to and fro, punch and counter-punch, even-handed nature of the contest created a frantic, nervous energy unmatched by any other league game this season. Against Brighton, the tension did not come from what was happening on the pitch, but the wait for something to happen. Specifically, it came from the wait for City to open the scoring as they were fully expected to do, and the rising, creeping fear that they would somehow be held at bay, turning the entire season on its head. One of those outcomes was always much more likely than the other, of course, and it eventually came to pass. Even if Mahrez’s opener arrived by way of several deflections, it was what City deserved for persevering against an organised Brighton set-up. But every minute the champions were made to wait, that tension inside the Etihad grew. Unlike in title races of the 1990s and 2000s, this is the atmosphere that the remainder of the 2021-22 edition will be played out in. City are heavily favoured to win all of their remaining games, so too are Liverpool. Both believe that they have to take maximum points from their run-in - 18 of 18 down from here on this home straight - or else the other will surely take advantage. “We are facing one of the best teams in football history,” Pep Guardiola said in his post-match press conference, when asked for his response to Liverpool’s mauling of Manchester United the previous night. “They have everything. The players know it, I know it.” Jurgen Klopp paid a similar tribute after the recent 2-2. Perhaps the only comfort both clubs, managers and sets of players can take amid all the tension is that they were in exactly the same situation in 2019 and both did what they had to do, even if in Liverpool’s case it was ultimately not enough. It certainly appeared as though City traded on that experience, at least. At deadlock against Brighton, it felt more than a little like the narrow wins over Burnley and Leicester City three years ago, when second-half goals rescued them from a dreaded draw. As the atmosphere inside the ground lost some of its composure, City kept theirs. “We’ve played with this pressure, having to win,” Guardiola said. “Like at Burnley, when Sergio [Aguero] scored. We have to play with that.” This is landscape City and Liverpool have created, the almost impossible bar they have set. Like three years ago, there will be moments when they worry they are about to fall short. But this time, at least, both can say they have been here before.

A spokesperson for the England international confirmed that the defender had taken precautions to contact the authorities after receiving the warning, but is still preparing “as normal” for his club’s upcoming fixture at the weekend. Maguire played as United lost 4-0 to Liverpool on Tuesday night and would be expected to be at the heart of the defensive line once more when they face another rival in Arsenal on Saturday. “In the last 24 hours, Harry has received a serious threat to his family home,” a statement from Maguire’s spokesperson read. “He has reported this to the police who are now looking into the matter. “The safety of his family and those around him is obviously Harry’s number one priority. He will continue to prepare for this weekend’s fixture as normal and we will not be commenting in any further detail at this time.” Maguire lives with his fiancee Fern Hawkins and their two children, with Cheshire Police understood to have undertaken a search of their property. United’s captain has hit the headlines for a string of unsteady performances on the pitch this season, with the team around him also struggling for consistency. The club announced earlier on Thursday that Erik ten Hag would be the new manager for next season, with the Ajax boss signing a three-year-deal with an option for an extra 12 months. 29-year-old Maguire, who signed in 2019, also has a deal which runs to 2025 with an optional year.

Ten Hag\'s appointment as United\'s new permanent manager was confirmed on Thursday morning, with the Ajax head coach signing a contract until 2025 including the option of a further year. Mitchell van der Gaag, Ten Hag\'s assistant at Ajax, is expected to follow him to Old Trafford. Negotiations between United and the 50-year-old are said to be ongoing but advanced.  Ten Hag is also understood to be keen to reunite with McClaren, having worked as his assistant during the former England manager\'s first season in charge of FC Twente. Discussions are now set to take place with the 60-year-old, who is under consideration to work alongside Van der Gaag as Ten Hag’s backroom team takes shape. United have insisted that no backroom appointments have been made or are expected imminently but are open to their new manager’s recommendations. The Old Trafford club are keen to go through a thorough process with Ten Hag to assess what support staff he will require and evaluate those already working at the club. Steve McClaren was Manchester United’s assistant manager between 1999 and 2001 The incoming United manager hopes to dip into McClaren’s experience of United’s inner-workings during the glory days under Sir Alex Ferguson. McClaren joined as an assistant to Ferguson midway through the historic treble-winning 1998-99 campaign and was part of a backroom staff that won a further two Premier League titles before his departure in 2001. Several members of predecessor Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\'s backroom staff left the club shortly after his dismissal was confirmed last November, with Michael Carrick, Kieran McKenna and Martyn Pert all departing. That exodus left interim manager Ralf Rangnick depending upon short-term appointments of Chris Armas and Ewan Sharp, who had links to Solskjaer’s replacement through the Red Bull football project. Mike Phelan - another veteran of the Ferguson era, who returned to the club under Solskjaer - signed a new contract extension until 2024 last October has taken on a less prominent role since Rangnick\'s arrival.

(29, '/sport/football/erik-ten-hag-manchester-united-manager-b2062390.html', 2, 'independent', 'Ten Hag excited by challenge of bringing success back to Man United', 'Erik ten Hag is excited by the challenge of bringing success back to stuttering Manchester United when he takes over as manager at the end of the season. Without a permanent boss since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s exit in November, the club initially worked under caretaker Michael Carrick before Ralf Rangnick took charge on an interim basis. It has been a chastening season for all connected to United and the club confirmed on Thursday that Ten Hag will take charge this summer. The impressive Ajax boss is looking to wrap up a third Eredivisie title before moving to Old Trafford, subject to work visa requirements, on a deal until 2025, which includes the option of a further year. Ten Hag impressed the United hierarchy with his long-term vision for the club and proved the unanimous choice, with the 52-year-old seen as having the drive and nous to lead them back to the top. “It is a great honour to be appointed manager of Manchester United and I am hugely excited by the challenge ahead,” the Dutchman said. “I know the history of this great club and the passion of the fans, and I am absolutely determined to develop a team capable of delivering the success they deserve. “It will be difficult to leave Ajax after these incredible years, and I can assure our fans of my complete commitment and focus on bringing this season to a successful conclusion before I move to Manchester United.” Ten Hag has a huge challenge on his hands given the squad is bloated, unbalanced and incapable of challenging for major trophies. United’s 4-0 mauling at rivals Liverpool on Tuesday underlined the work required to turn around the 20-time champions, who have failed to launch a sustained title bid since last winning the league in 2013. Long-admired Paris St Germain boss Mauricio Pochettino was initially considered favourite to succeed Solskjaer, but Ten Hag ended up as the undisputed choice following a rigorous process. Football director John Murtough said: “During the past four years at Ajax, Erik has proved himself to be one of the most exciting and successful coaches in Europe, renowned for his team’s attractive, attacking football and commitment to youth. “In our conversations with Erik leading up to this appointment, we were deeply impressed with his long-term vision for returning Manchester United to the level we want to be competing at, and his drive and determination to achieve that. “We wish Erik the best of luck as he focuses on achieving a successful end to the season at Ajax and look forward to welcoming him to Manchester United this summer.” Murtough and technical director Darren Fletcher led the search for Solskjaer’s permanent successor, with chief executive Richard Arnold joining in the final stages of the process. It is understood Ten Hag was considered to be the candidate that is most closely aligned to United’s identity and strategy, given his track record of winning, developing youth, improving players and playing attacking football. The 52-year-old has been head coach of Ajax since January 2018, having previously spent time in charge of Go Ahead Eagles, Bayern Munich II and Utrecht. Ten Hag led the Amsterdam side on a remarkable run to the Champions League semi-finals in 2019 and has overseen two Eredivisie title triumphs during that time. Erik ten Hag has plenty on his to-do list at Manchester United (Adam Davy/PA) Ajax are looking to win a third as they sit four points clear of second-placed PSV Eindhoven, who beat Ten Hag’s side 2-1 in the Dutch Cup final last Sunday. “I’m happy that it has been finalised and that it has been officially announced,” Ten Hag said. “That clarity is important. “But I only have one interest now and that’s these last five games. I want to finish my time here on a positive note, by winning the league. “By doing so, we’ll qualify directly for the Champions League. Ajax belongs there.” Edwin van der Sar, the former United goalkeeper who is now Ajax’s chief executive, expressed his gratitude for Ten Hag’s work after striking an agreement with United. “Four-and-a-half years is a good amount of time, but we would have liked to have kept Erik at Ajax for longer,” he said. “He is going to make the step to one of the biggest clubs in the world, in a fantastic league. “We owe Erik a lot of thanks for what he has achieved with Ajax so far, but we are not done yet. At the end of the season, I will look back more extensively on his departure. “For now, what matters is the final games of the season in which we all want to bring home the league title.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

The Reds released a statement on Thursday saying they were “saddened” by a rise in instances of such chanting. A minority of Manchester City fans disrupted a minute’s silence in memory of the 97 victims of the 1989 disaster during last Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool at Wembley. “Liverpool FC is saddened by the recent rise in vile chants about the Hillsborough disaster,” a club statement read. “We know the impact these abhorrent slurs have on the families of the 97, those who survived, and all associated with this club. “We are working with the relevant authorities to do our utmost to ensure these chants are eradicated from football altogether and, where appropriate, bring the full force of the law and the game’s sanction process down on those who continue to sing them.” City released a statement condemning the actions of some of their fans and the club’s manager Pep Guardiola said: “This is not Manchester City. We are close to Liverpool for the tragedy that happened years ago. We are alongside them. (The chants) don’t represent what we are.” An inquest in 2016 ruled that the fans who had died at Hillsborough were unlawfully killed amid a catalogue of failings by the emergency services.

Conte signed the Denmark international from Spurs when he was in charge at Inter Milan in January 2020 and the pair won the Serie A title together the following season. Eriksen is now at Brentford and enjoying a remarkable comeback from the cardiac arrest he suffered playing for his country in Euro 2020. The 30-year-old comes up against his former club for the first time on Saturday as Spurs visit the Bees. Conte, who admitted to meeting with Eriksen when the Dane returned to London in January, said: “I’m very happy to see him play football again. “In June it was terrible, those images were terrible for everybody. We suffered a lot for him and his family. To see him for a game will be a pleasure for me. It’s incredible because not long ago what happened. “To see him playing again makes me very happy because I know football is life. To have this opportunity is great for him and his family because now they come back to have a normal life.” In June it was terrible, those images were terrible for everybody. We suffered a lot for him and his family Spurs will visit west London needing to win after Arsenal’s impressive victory against Chelsea in midweek saw them move level on points. The Gunners play again before Spurs at the weekend as the pressure cranks up in the final six games. Conte said. “Six games to go. We have to stay in this race. Now for sure, in this race I want to try to stay until the end. We know very well the difficulty to compete with other teams. “I don’t think Chelsea is in this race. They are in this moment on a different level. They are there because they missed some games but they don’t stay in this race. “We have to fight with Arsenal, they showed yesterday they are in good form, Man Utd, West Ham and Wolverhampton. “Now we have to fight until the end. The last second of the last game, we will see which will be our place in the table.” Spurs handed Oliver Skipp a new contract on Wednesday and Conte says the youngster will be a big player for the future. He has not featured for Spurs since January after an ongoing injury but the Italian is still thinking big things of his midfielder. “I’m very happy for Skippy because we are talking about a good player, a young player from the academy,” Conte said. “We know very well a player who has developed. He’s not only a good player, we are talking about a fantastic guy. “He’s having a bit of problem with his injury. I know his frustration. I think his new contract shows we trust him a lot.

(33, '/sport/football/fifa-uefa-super-league-clubs-punishment-b2062424.html', 2, 'independent', 'Court lifts block on Fifa and Uefa punishing Super League clubs', 'A Spanish court has lifted measures that shielded the clubs that want to create a European Super League competition from being punished by Uefa and Fifa. In court documents seen by The Associated Press on Thursday, a court in Madrid said it was removing the legal protection because even if the clubs are punished that would not impede them from going forward with the plan to create a breakaway competition beyond Uefa’s control. Of the original 12 clubs that wanted to create the Super League, only Spanish teams Real Madrid and Barcelona and Italian club Juventus still openly back its creation. “It has in no way been demonstrated that the threat of sanctions to the three clubs would lead to the impossibility of carrying out the project,” judge Sofia Gil wrote in her ruling. Gil dismissed concerns presented by the clubs that punishment from soccer’s governing bodies would ruin their chances of attracting financing for the Super League. The ruling can be appealed. Last April, a different Spanish judge had ordered Fifa and Uefa to “refrain from taking any measure or action, or from issuing any statement, which prevents or hinders, directly or indirectly, the preparation of the European Super League.” That move came amid threats that the Super League teams would be banned from playing in the Champions League.

(34, '/sport/football/stamford-bridge-the-blues-andreas-christensen-emile-smith-rowe-premier-league-b20624', 2, 'independent', 'Chelsea boss Tuchel critical of ‘very difficult’ Stamford Bridge pitch', 'Thomas Tuchel has blamed the state of Chelsea’s pitch for the Blues leaking two costly goals at Stamford Bridge in recent weeks. Tuchel moved to protect Andreas Christensen after his under-hit back-pass gifted Eddie Nketiah Arsenal the opening goal in Arsenal’s 4-2 Premier League win at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday. Edouard Mendy’s scuffed pass sold Antonio Rudiger short against Real Madrid on 6 April, allowing Karim Benzema to tap in to complete his hat-trick in the Blues’ 3-1 Champions League quarter-final first-leg defeat on home soil. Christensen was withdrawn at half-time on Wednesday but Blues boss Tuchel insisted the Denmark defender was replaced by Thiago Silva due to injury, before claiming that the Stamford Bridge turf is causing problems for his players. “Andreas said he could not continue so I think he had some problems and that’s why,” said Tuchel. “I don’t take a player off because he makes one mistake. “I have to also say the pitch is difficult to play here. Maybe it sounds like an excuse but it is a very difficult pitch that we have here and it’s not in our favour. “The ball bounced very awkwardly in front of Andreas when he tried to play this ball and we also had the same mistake against Real Madrid that cost us in the Champions League.” Chelsea toppled European giants Real 3-2 at the Bernabeu in the quarter-final second leg but still exited the Champions League 5-4 on aggregate. The Blues’ loss to Arsenal set an unwanted run of three home defeats in a row in all competitions for the first time since 1993. Chelsea have leaked 11 goals across those three defeats, firstly in a 4-1 reverse at the hands of Brentford after the latest international break before the Real and Arsenal games. Nketiah bagged a brace on Wednesday, with Emile Smith Rowe slotting a smart finish and Bukayo Saka converting a late penalty. Chelsea twice equalised in the first half through Timo Werner and captain Cesar Azpilicueta, but the Blues were unable to raise the tempo or the quality after the interval. The Blues remain third in the table and still in full control of their destiny as regards qualifying for next term’s Champions League. Fifth-placed Arsenal reignited their own qualification quest for Europe’s top table, drawing level on points with fourth-placed Tottenham in just their second win in six league matches. Nketiah’s goals were his first for the Gunners in 367 days. The 22-year-old is out of contract at Arsenal this summer and has been linked with a move away from the Emirates. Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta revealed after Nketiah’s brace that he has not given the Lewisham-born forward enough first-team action this term. “If there’s one player that I’ve been unfair with, I think it’s him,” said Arteta. “He has given me every right to do something different so if Eddie hasn’t played more it’s my fault and because as a manager and I miss something or I haven’t had the courage to play him more and he showed me how wrong I was.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(35, '/sport/football/liverpool-everton-merseyside-derby-hillsborough-b2063088.html', 2, 'independent', 'Liverpool vs Everton won’t deliver the friendly derby Merseyside needs', 'After a week that contained a double dose of Hillsborough-related Mancunian bile, Merseyside badly needs a friendly derby. The likelihood of getting it is slim. Everton go to Anfield on Sunday desperate for points in the battle against relegation. Frank Lampard’s team are a shambles and clinging on to their Premier League status by their fingernails. After Burnley’s 2-0 victory over Southampton last night, the threat of the drop feels very real. Liverpool are chasing a quadruple. They are in rampant form. Their 3-2 victory over Manchester City in the FA Cup semi-final did not reflect the dominance of Jurgen Klopp’s team. The 4-0 rout of Manchester United on Tuesday could have had a much more lopsided scoreline. The chances of Everton stopping the red juggernaut appear to be slim. There are a significant number of Kopites who dream of an addition to the quad. They want a ‘fiver,’ with Everton’s relegation making up the fifth element of a fantasy season. Chants of ‘Going down,’ are bound to echo around Anfield if Liverpool go in front. The potential response from the away section concerns sensible supporters on both sides. When discussing the possibility of their team getting something on Sunday, one Evertonian on social media was both realistic and pessimistic. “My only real hope is that there are no idiotic chants from the Everton end.” Despite the overwhelming majority of Blues maintaining 100 per cent support for their Red counterparts over Hillsborough, there has long been a minority whose partisanship has stretched beyond the boundaries of good sense and decency. In some respects, the bitterness predates 1989 by decades. There were always stories floating around the city about Liverpudlians who would never wear blue, to the point of eschewing jeans. Likewise, there were tales of Gwladys Streetenders who would not have red in the house and who refused to buy items like Coca-Cola because of the colour of the branding. These acts of football-related defiance became part of Merseyside folklore. Individuals frequently refused to set foot in the other team’s ground under any circumstances, which made it difficult for embittered Liverpool supporters when FA Cup semi-finals were held at Goodison in the 1970s and 80s. Irrational fanaticism has always been an undercurrent at both clubs. Relations between the two fanbases have deteriorated badly in the past 25 years. The main flashpoint is another deadly stadium disaster, Heysel. There, at the 1985 European Cup final between Liverpool and Juventus, 39 mainly Italian fans were killed after a charge by the Merseyside club’s supporters caused a panicked crush. A wall collapsed under the weight of people amid horrific scenes. The tragedy led to English sides being banned from Europe for five years. That decision was politically driven and completely unfair on all the teams involved except Liverpool, who eventually served a six-year ban. Of the 14 other clubs affected, Everton were the hardest hit, missing out on European competition for four of those seasons. By the 10th anniversary of Heysel, a myth had begun to coalesce that the incident was primarily responsible for Everton’s decline as a top-flight power. The truth is much more complex. In the summer of 1985, mere weeks after the catastrophe in Brussels, Howard Kendall was able to attract Gary Lineker, the most sought-after goalscorer in the game, to Goodison. The decision to allow Kendall to leave for Athletic Bilbao in 1987 after Everton had won the title started the rot. Kendall was frustrated by the lack of European competition but would have stayed at Goodison if the board had matched the Basque club’s offer at any point before the last possible moment. By the time Everton were prepared to pay Kendall the going rate, it was too late. That was the first in a series of bad decisions by successive regimes that put the team in the shadow of their neighbours. That trend continues to this day. Heysel had an impact at Goodison – and it cannot be forgotten that Liverpool would have qualified for Europe in all six seasons they were exiled – but most of the reasons for Everton’s underperformance are self-inflicted. The nonsense is not all one-sided. It is mindboggling given the events of the past 33 years but a section of Liverpool supporters are not beyond using other people’s dead to score points at football matches. A banner featuring the European Cup and the words ‘Steaua Bucharest 1986’ was displayed on the Kop at derbies. Steaua won the continent’s most prestigious trophy the year that Kendall’s great Everton side should have been in the competition but were excluded because of the ban. The flag is provocative and hugely offensive. Anyone who claims it does not link directly to Heysel is being disingenuous. Nevertheless, it is not as simplistic as one side being as bad as the other. A much more significant proportion of Evertonians than Liverpudlians indulge in such behaviour. The reasons for this are obvious: for Liverpool supporters Heysel brings shame, Hillsborough pain. The chant of ‘Murderers,’ is frequently heard at derbies. Evertonians say they are referring to Heysel, as if that is a mitigation or justification. On Monday night, United supporters used the word, too. When they sang ‘The Sun was right, you’re murderers,’ that was clearly about Hillsborough. Only a fool would argue that there are no dots to be joined here. The overarching suspicion is that some of the more extreme elements in the Everton fanbase want those connections to be made. The song that many of those associated with Hillsborough really find offensive, though, is often heard shamelessly booming from the away section. “Always the victims, it’s never your fault,” has been a staple for years for supporters of almost every team to play away at Liverpool. The hardcore minorities sing about murderers but the majority have no compunction about chanting about victims. Everyone is expecting it from the Everton end on Sunday. The explanations for the meaning of this chant vary, depending on the moment. Sometimes it is said to be about Heysel. On other occasions it is claimed to refer to the Luis Suarez-Patrice Evra racism incident. Either way, the rationale is risible. Especially from local Evertonians, who are lumped into the way the city is seen from the outside regardless of the team they follow. The classic example of how this anti-Scouse trope affects everyone in the region came in the leading article of The Spectator when the magazine was under the editorship of Boris Johnson. The people of the city, the piece argued, “see themselves, whenever possible as victims, and resent their victim status, yet at the same time they wallow in it.” This was not written about Hillsborough, or football, but about Merseyside’s reaction to the beheading of Kenneth Bigley by jihadis in Iraq. It makes no distinction between Reds and Blues, matchgoers or people who have no interest in football. It is breathtaking in its sweeping offensiveness. Do Evertonians think they are somehow exempt from such opinions when they spout the ‘victims’ gibberish? “It’s a Hillsborough song,” Richie Greaves, who was in pen 3 on the Leppings Lane in 1989 and is now secretary of the Hillsborough Survivors’ Association, said. “It’s obvious. When else were we the victims?” Most Liverpool supporters feel the same way, something that has been made clear to Everton fans over the years. Yet it continues to be sung. “It’s a bit like the ‘Chelsea Rent Boys’ song,” Greaves said. “Loads sang it for years, then got told it was offensive and most people stopped singing it. If you continue in the knowledge of how it’s received, then it’s clear you don’t care about the feelings of those on the other end. ‘Always the victims’ is a Hillsborough song. It’s as simple as that.” Each side can catalogue a list of horror stories that they can attribute to the other to explain the deterioration in the friendly derby. ‘Whataboutery’ characterises and ruins any serious discussion of these matters. The blinkered nature of diehard fans mean they rarely see things rationally and that goes way beyond Merseyside. There will undoubtedly be a passionate atmosphere at Anfield on Sunday  Abuse over Hillsborough is growing. Not just in Manchester. Shrewsbury Town and Brentford fans have made news this year with their behaviour but plenty of other examples have gone under the radar. The last thing the city needs – especially after the week of the 33rd anniversary was overshadowed by City and United’s disdain for the dead – is for the idea of Hillsborough as ‘banter’ to be amplified at a derby. How bad has it been? Charlotte Hennessy, whose dad Jimmy died on the Leppings Lane at the age of 29 when his daughter was just six, said: “This year’s anniversary has been one of the worst. I’ve spent every day dealing with trolls and abusers.” That horrifies the many, many Evertonians who have worked alongside their Liverpudlian friends and families in pursuit of justice. The first place a line must be drawn about this kind of conduct is on Merseyside. Even if the ‘friendship’ is fraying across Stanley Park, there are limits to what is acceptable. If Sunday turns ugly, both sides will be damaged – Liverpool emotionally and Everton reputationally. No one wants that.

(36, '/sport/football/erik-ten-hag-manchester-united-pochettino-b2062754.html', 2, 'independent', 'A proven winner who fits the club: Why Man United hired Ten Hag', 'After a long, protracted but careful process spanning the best part of five months, Manchester United have their new permanent manager in place. Erik ten Hag will take the reins at Old Trafford having signed a contract potentially running until 2026. He is the successor to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the replacement for Ralf Rangnick and the fifth manager to follow Sir Alex Ferguson in the space of just nine years. In Ten Hag, United believe that they have secured the services of a proven winner who fits the club’s core principles of an attractive, attacking style of play and a fierce commitment to developing youth. Senior Old Trafford figures have been impressed by his record of improving players as a coach on the training ground as much as the results he has picked up on the way to winning two Eredivisie titles in his only two full seasons, with a third title still left to play for. Ten Hag’s backroom staff is now beginning to take shape. The appointment of Mitchell van der Gaag, Ten Hag’s assistant at Ajax, is expected to follow. Negotiations with the 50-year-old are understood to be ongoing but at an advanced stage. Ten Hag is also keen to link up with Steve McClaren, having worked as his assistant at FC Twente, and wants the former assistant to Ferguson for his experience of the club’s inner-workings during its glory days. Restoring said glory days has been the objective of each man appointed to the role since David Moyes, not to mention those behind the appointments themselves. Yet the identity of Old Trafford’s key decision-makers has changed since those days and so too has the process which led to Ten Hag’s appointment. There is no ‘chosen one’ - Moyes’ moniker - this time around. Or at least, if there is, he has been chosen by committee. The search for Solskjaer’s successor was led by the figure at the forefront of United’s restructured football operations, the de-facto director of football John Murtough. The newly-installed chief executive Richard Arnold is said to have only engaged during its final stages. But Ten Hag is described as the unanimous choice of Murtough, Arnold and technical director Darren Fletcher, his appointment a product of United\'s restructured football department. If that is the case, then with unanimity comes collective responsibility. This is the first big, era-defining call that United’s new-look internal structure has had to make, if we judge the decision to appoint an interim manager as part and parcel of the same process. Some argue that by hiring a temporary stop-gap in the shape of Rangnick, United jettisoned an entire season. But if doing so allowed time for a full, considered search to find the right manager, it could still prove to be the right choice. Ten Hag became United\'s first-choice but was not the early favourite. Mauricio Pochettino was heavily fancied, as he has been since that infamous Mayfair lunch with Ferguson while still in charge of Tottenham Hotspur in 2016. The favour of the Scot still counts for something at United, such is his enduring influence, but extracting Pochettino from Paris Saint-Germain in the middle of the season would always be difficult and United were nevertheless committed to a thorough and detailed search. Erik ten Hag surpassed Mauricio Pochettino to become United’s first choice  It was around the middle of March - when the process was stepped up a notch - that whispers began to emerge about momentum building behind Ten Hag’s candidacy. Pochettino had just suffered a humiliating turnaround to exit the Champions League at the hands of Real Madrid but Ten Hag’s Ajax had also been surprisingly knocked out by Benfica. Those results were never likely to sway United’s decision but face-to-face interviews would. Those in the room when Ten Hag sat down with United executives later that month are said to have been taken by the energy and enthusiasm that the 52-year-old showed for the challenge and the long-term vision that he clearly set out. United quickly came to believe that Ten Hag was the candidate most closely aligned with their identity, strategy and the existing club structure. And though not a decisive factor, Ten Hag’s path to the manager’s office at Carrington was smoothed by healthy, pre-existing relationships between United, his employers and his representatives. Much has been made of United’s connection to Edwin van der Sar, their one-time goalkeeper and Ajax’s chief executive. That relationship remains strong despite the struggles of Donny van de Beek in Manchester. Ten Hag is the winner of two Eredivise titles and a third could follow this season  Ten Hag’s representatives SEG International, meanwhile, have a working relationship with United dating back to the era of Ferguson and former chief executive David Gill, having worked on the negotiations to bring Robin van Persie to Old Trafford. SEG also acted in talks with Ed Woodward over Louis van Gaal’s appointment. “Now history repeats itself with Richard Arnold and Erik ten Hag,” the agency’s founder, Kees Vos, said upon confirmation of the appointment. Concerns about Ten Hag’s lack of experience managing in any of Europe’s top leagues are valid but counterbalanced in the minds of United’s hierarchy by Ajax’s dominance of Dutch football under his tenure, the extraordinary run to the Champions League semi-finals in 2019 and his experience of operating at Bayern Munich, where he worked under Pep Guardiola for two years as the reserve team manager. There are still loose ends to be tied up outside of the backroom staff. Ten Hag’s first day on the job is yet to be confirmed but is expected to fall earlier than 1 July. He has already had an input into plans and procedures ahead of next season but his focus will remain with Ajax until the Eredivisie campaign has reached its end and a third Eredivisie crown is secure. “I can assure our fans of my complete commitment and focus on bringing this season to a successful conclusion before I move,” he said. And then, United hope the nine-year wait for a fitting Ferguson replacement will be over. If Ten Hag still finds that he is gainfully employed in the job once another nine years have passed, he will have more than repaid his new employers’ faith in his abilities. Given the chronic underachievement at Old Trafford since 2013, that is not a particularly high bar, but as each of Ten Hag’s predecessors would likely tell him, it is still a tremendously hard one to clear.

(37, '/sport/football/manchester-united-erik-ten-hag-roadmap-b2063104.html', 2, 'independent', '‘All about simplicity’: Plotting Man Utd’s roadmap back to the top', 'When the Manchester United squad were told of Erik ten Hag’s pending appointment, the response was said to be “mixed”, but one specific response stood out. Some players were totally indifferent, because they don’t want to be around to find out. It sums up the scale of the challenge. For all of the buzz around Old Trafford after Ten Hag’s announcement, there was also some unease about how long it will take reality to check that excitement. The current reality is that United have just suffered a 4-0 defeat to Liverpool that was as pitiful as it was predictable, That made it a collective 15-1 in four games against the top two, who also happen to be their two biggest rivals. The occasion displayed such a disparity between the clubs that the only logical response should be to interrogate what Liverpool have done, and seek to update it. That’s curious, though, because that was the exact question put to former executive vice chairman Ed Woodward in a meeting at United’s London base in 2019. Why not just do what Manchester City and Liverpool do, identify a modern ideology, and go from there? Woodward responded that United deliberately didn’t have a defined style, because they wanted “a certain flexibility” so managers can work within broader parameters. There is admittedly a counter-intuitive business logic to that, but the brutal truth is that it was still going against what is widely seen as best football practice. It is also what Ralf Rangnick is practically screaming at the club now. He said it again before the Liverpool match and afterwards, while also laying out the guiding principles when asked what United could do to catch up. “The headline on everything should be ‘how do you want to play’!”, he said. The situation has been immensely frustrating Rangnick, and has only reasserted how far United are off the level. The last few days have been dominated by discussion about how long it will take them to get back, not least from the interim coach. That is also why it can - repeat, can - be a source of optimism. For all the issues at United, they can reach for a clear roadmap. That roadmap can also be followed much more quickly if you can pay the salaries the club are capable of. Such money means United are capable of succeeding even under the Glazers, and the ongoing effects of that lamentable 2005 leveraged buy-out. The £1bn-plus expenditure that has been held up as such a waste is also a clear sign of their potential power. They are arguably the only English club who can truly go toe to toe with City in terms of financial muscle. Imagine that money spent correctly. This is why Rangnick said “it will take two or three windows if you know what you are looking for”. They should know what to look to. Both Rangnick and even Ten Hag have made some steps clear in meetings.  If you had a truly blank slate, which many would argue this season should bring, you can work down from the top of the club. The repeated line from football people to The Independent has been that, actually, “it’s all about simplicity”. “It’s not rocket science,” as Rangnick himself said. A club first of all needs a good and experienced chief executive, who brings in an empowered sporting director. The point here is not the obviousness of hiring the best people for the senior positions. It is something that has actually been rather unclear at United: that football people are entrusted to make key decisions under their remit. You then get these same figures to identify and articulate a football ideology, from which everything else follows. This is what Rangnick meant by “the headline on everything”. That ideology should inform every decision, from the choice of coach to all signings. It means there is much less possibility for waste.  The recruitment department should then be constructed to the highest possible standard, and primarily guided by old-fashioned scouting insight and modern data analysis, with both of those overwhelmingly prioritised over agent relationships. Such an approach - which isn\'t as common as might be expected - would mean the ability to contextualise how well a player will work in your system, which remains the most important factor in signing players. From all that, a sporting director should have final say on all signings within an existing budget. The club should also be ruthless with outgoing players, because of the profound drag effect a disgruntled few can have on the rest of the squad. You couldn’t have a better example of that than at Old Trafford. By contrast, Arsenal, who United play next, have gradually started to realise the benefits of such clear-outs. It has a value way beyond transfer fees. Paul Pogba is one of a number of players set to leave  This is the situation any manager should be walking into. This is something individual managers can also help enforce, if they have requisite charisma and vision. It is what Jurgen Klopp has done at Liverpool, radiating the focus that brought so many different parts of their formative structure together in 2015. Pep Guardiola has probably been on the other side of it, walking into a fully formed club at City, which is what Ten Hag was used to on a lower scale at Ajax. The big question is whether the Dutch coach can help bring this at United. Because, as elementary as it all sounds, so much of it has been missing at Old Trafford. And even now, after so many frank meetings with Rangnick, there’s a big difference between knowing the path and following it. This may be where the Glazer ownership brings a bigger problem than even those huge interest payments. While United still have so much revenue they can overcome the effect of all that cash going out, it’s much more difficult to get around their corporate structure. Everything has to go through Joel Glazer. “He makes all the big decisions,” is a repeated line, from those who have worked within the club and with it. That process applies to so much, from managerial appointments to business calls. As a basic example, fitness equipment companies have recently been tendering for the new gym at Carrington. There has been frustration, however, because “everything has to be sent to Florida meaning no one can sign off on anything. Even on something as small as that.” Figures who have worked with United believe it’s impossible to detach this from the nature of the 2005 buy-out, which has ensured everything is a hardline business decision. That might be inevitable. It has just had the adverse effect of ensuring United aren’t as commercially attractive as they could be, because they are not successful. The process has ultimately meant that football decisions are, at the very least, influenced by people whose main expertise is not football. There have even been murmurs of surveying online reaction. Liverpool’s owners, by contrast, quickly realised the best business practice was to trust the best people. Whether United have the best people on the football side is another question. There is now significant public pressure on both John Murtough and Darren Fletcher. So far, they have not blown away peers at rival clubs. That need not necessarily be a mark against their careers, and they could develop into prominent figures in European football. It’s just that’s precisely the problem. A main job at United, as with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, should not be a finishing school. Sporting directors at such clubs should have years experience at the top of the game. United simply don’t have such an individual anywhere in their infrastructure. Paul Mitchell, now of Monaco and formerly of Leipzig and Tottenham Hotspur, has spoken to United about a role. He would want total control of recruitment, though, and that may not fit with the current structure. A shake-up is expected in that area, of course, as signalled by the departures of Jim Lawlor and Marcel Bout. United do have to considerably sharpen up from a system that saw them widely boast about how Aaron Wan-Bissaka emerged as the right-back signing out of an initial database of more than 800 names. This is where the ability to “contextualise how well a player will work in your system” is essential. Given how Wan-Bissaka’s specific strength in close challenges does not suit the role he has been used in, the 24-year-old could serve as a personification of the problem. More indicative, however, is Jadon Sancho. He was a glamorous young English name who United had chased for some time, because of superb Borussia Dortmund form built on making darting runs from starting positions near the touchline. Sancho was often devastating. So what did Solskjaer do with him? The Norwegian attempted to almost exclusively play Sancho with overlapping full-backs in a narrow role. There should be no wonder there has been such a disconnect for the winger, because his signing just betrays disjointed thinking. Sancho has often been used poorly following his summer move  You can go right through the squad, but the wider point is that so many players are performing beneath themselves because they are not being used according to any unifying idea. That’s how other problems, like loss of confidence and an increase in unrest, start to fester. It is how a group can develop bad habits, and why you start to need a clear-out. So many coaches and staff over the past few years found a “much more difficult dressing room” than they anticipated. A fair consideration here is that any player can look completely different under a new manager, when played in the right role. You only have to look at Spurs’ Matt Doherty under Antonio Conte, or Victor Moses at Chelsea before him. One certainty about Ten Hag is that he is a fine training-ground coach, who has a track record of improving players. He is also a first for many of this Manchester United squad, in that he is a manager who works according to the most cutting-edge principles. That probably hasn’t been true of any of their permanent managers since Sir Alex Ferguson. Rangnick meanwhile didn’t have the authority that comes with being a permanent manager, but also found he didn’t have a squad used to the principles of what he describes as “ball-oriented pressing”. This is something Ten Hag is going to have to work through, too. It is one reason he told the club this could take up to five years. It is possible it will be quicker. It is possible that fundamental good coaching, and a more focused group, will get around an awful lot. United will surely return to more competitive levels, and at least a situation where they are qualifying for the Champions League with relative ease. That should be the bare minimum at such a club. But to the levels of City and Liverpool, where absolutely everything is going in the one direction, and that is right to the top? That is where United should be. It’s just going to take much more than a managerial appointment.

(41, '/sport/football/christian-eriksen-tottenham-antonio-conte-brentford-b2063142.html', 2, 'independent', 'As Eriksen and Tottenham meet again, can they be what the other needs?', 'There will be an emotional reunion between Christian Eriksen and Tottenham Hotspur at the Brentford Community Stadium on Saturday. In time, there could be another, more permanent one. In early February, days after Eriksen signed for Brentford on a short-term contract, Antonio Conte opened the door to a return to Spurs. He didn’t quite guide him through, though. At that point, seven months on from suffering a cardiac arrest and requiring life-saving treatment while playing for Denmark at Euro 2020, Eriksen had yet to step back onto a football pitch and there were doubts over whether he would be able to at all.  Now Eriksen is leading a Brentford side who are standing in Tottenham’s path to the top four and Champions League qualification. The midfielder’s return to football has been one of the stories of the season and he has made a wonderful impact in west London, inspiring a club who looked to be sliding towards relegation and steering them away from danger. Brentford have won all five games in which Eriksen has started and come into Saturday’s match second only to Liverpool in the Premier League form table. Eriksen has been decisive, and Tottenham are looking to be the same as they enter their final straight. Conte’s side have six games of the season remaining to finish above rivals Arsenal and secure a top four finish. Whether Spurs beat Arsenal to fourth place or not is set to have a major influence on the discussions Conte will be having with director of football Fabio Paratici and a list of targets is already being drawn up ahead of the summer transfer window. There is expected to be a significant overhaul of Tottenham’s squad in what is a crucial phase for the club as they prepare for what is set to be Conte’s first full season in charge. Eriksen has been mentioned as a potential option, and indeed was so even before he returned to the pitch with Brentford in February, following his exit from Inter Milan on the grounds that he could not continue playing in Italy while his heart was fitted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator device. Conte was surprised when Eriksen signed for Brentford on January deadline day as he thought the midfielder needed more time before coming back to play in England. The Italian is loyal to players he trusts and gained faith in Eriksen, who came through a difficult start in Italy to become a central part of his title winning team at Inter Milan. Conte would welcome Eriksen back to Tottenham  In January Conte and Paratici turned to players they knew in Italy in Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur, while Tottenham looked to streamline their squad once they were out of Europe. Conte had been allowed time to look at the players at his disposal and out went Dele Alli, Tanguy Ndombele and Giovanni Lo Celso. In turn Tottenham have benefitted from Conte knowing his strongest team and building familiarity, at the expense of having a deeper squad. There could be further outgoings but the focus this summer will be on adding numbers, with attacking midfield one of several areas requiring reinforcements. The upcoming window was always likely to be their first major test and Tottenham will be under no illusions that Conte will expect his demands to be met as he looks to build a squad capable of challenging for the Premier League title and major honours. The offer of Champions League football would be a further advantage, with Arsenal and Manchester United also likely to undergo major shifts in personnel this summer and only one place between them. Ralf Rangnick has said United are looking at bringing in a list of up to ten players and Tottenham might not be too far behind. Conte will want players who match him and his system.  Which brings us to Eriksen. Brentford want him to stay and Thomas Frank thinks they have a chance. Even without the emotion of his return to the pitch, the 30-year-old’s impact at the club has made him one of the signings of the season and there would be a certain romance to Eriksen staying beyond the campaign. But how long can it last, realistically. The objectives of his move to the club have already been completed. He has returned to football. He has helped Brentford by injecting life into their season and battle to avoid relegation. In turn, he is back in the Denmark squad and has twice scored for his country, a major step in his stated goal to play at the World Cup in November. Eriksen is aiming to play at the World Cup after scoring on his Denmark return  It is a rare example of a move that has been equally beneficial to both parties and the guarantee of regular game time ahead of the World Cup could yet be key to Brentford’s offer. But Eriksen will also be faced with the temptation of getting back to where he was, performing in the Champions League and competing for titles under one of the best managers in Europe. Ultimately, whether that is where he wants to be is up to him. Tottenham could potentially be as suitable a destination in the summer as Brentford were in January. It is presumably also a simple and cost-effective deal to do, while Spurs have been often looked short of a player like Eriksen ever since he left. Spurs will be able to offer familiarity and Eriksen would be welcomed home. It’s funny how even that has changed. Eriksen was key to Spurs’ best years under Mauricio Pochettino, a scorer of great goals and provider of better assists in his seven seasons at the club and twice their player of the year. But his exit in January 2020 was sour, as were his final months at the club after Pochettino was sacked. He wanted to leave, and Tottenham fans didn’t appreciate his efforts to do so in public – but a lot, to put it bluntly, has happened since. Instead, Spurs fans at Brentford on Saturday will greet Eriksen as one of their own. There will be reminders of the past as Eriksen faces Spurs in a match that is significant to their future. In time, they could again find that they are exactly what the other needs.

(42, '/sport/football/liverpool-fc-quadruple-jurgen-klopp-b2063216.html', 2, 'independent', 'Liverpool exceeding Klopp’s expectations with quadruple bid', 'Jurgen Klopp has admitted he had “no idea” Liverpool would be challenging for the quadruple this year after revealing he feared they would spend this season in the Europa Conference League. Liverpool dropped as low as eighth last spring as they suffered six successive home defeats and were without a senior fit specialist centre-back. Now they could become the first club to win the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup in the same season and while Klopp believed Liverpool would be better this season, he said they have exceeded his expectations. Sunday marks the one-year anniversary of a 1-1 draw with Newcastle, when Joe Willock’s injury-time equaliser threatened to end Liverpool’s chances of qualifying for the Champions League. It left Liverpool sixth with five games to go, but they took 15 points from the last 15 available, including an improbable victory at West Bromwich Albion when goalkeeper Alisson headed an injury-time decider. And Klopp said: “I didn’t expect us to win the Carabao Cup, be in the FA Cup final, the semi-final of the Champions League and one point behind the leader of the [Premier League] table but I knew we would be better. “What the boys did last year was really special in such a difficult situation, to get qualified for the Champions League was massive. There were a lot of moments before the Newcastle game where I thought that is difficult, and that we will not make it. “We had moments where we thought: ‘Hopefully we don’t have to play in the Conference League.’ We don’t know exactly where we will go to. And then the boys won five games in a spectacular manner. West Brom, Ali, header, all these kind of things: outstanding. I loved each bit of it.” Liverpool signed Ibrahima Konate in the summer, while Virgil van Dijk, Joel Matip and Joe Gomez returned to fitness, giving Klopp confidence they would do better with a full complement of centre-backs. Yet they were 14 points behind Manchester City before winning 11 of their last 12 league games. Klopp added: “We knew in the moment when we can bring Ibou and the other three boys are back we will be stronger and when you are third and will be stronger and have a bad year for different reasons, it is a normal human reaction that you intensify pretty much all efforts and we did. “Then we had an absolutely okay start to the season but it is not as though people were over the moon [when we were] 14 points behind the leader and again what the boys made of that was pretty special so far. That we will be in this position, I had no idea about.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

The Dutchman, who will remain in charge of Ajax until the end of the season, was announced as the the club’s next permanent manager on Thursday. But Neville, who described Man Utd’s 4-0 defeat to Liverpool as the worst he has seen the team in his 42 years of watching, feels it will take Ten Hag a significant amount of time before he can add to their trophy cabinet. Speaking to Sky Sports he said: “What we’re seeing at this current moment is unacceptable. That needs to be dealt with initially and Ten Hag has got a big job to get the club back up to those minimum standards that they need to achieve, which is attitude, work ethic, belief, confidence and then hopefully you start to think about winning trophies. “But honestly, I wouldn’t be putting too much pressure on Ten Hag in the first one or two years to win a trophy at the club. It would be great if he did and he’d be overachieving, in my opinion. “It will be: get into the top four, re-establish Man Utd in the Champions League, attract the players into the club who can play in the way he wants to play, and then get a system of belief. “It took Jurgen Klopp four or five years to win a Premier League title, as great a job as he’s done. I wouldn’t be putting pressure on Ten Hag in the first two or three years to win a Premier League title. They’re a million miles away from that currently.” Manchester United lost 4-0 at Liverpool on Tuesday night after an abject display  Manchester United have suffered another trophyless season, making it five years since they last claimed silverware of any kind. They are also set to miss out on Champions League qualification for next season. With just five Premier League games remaining, Ralf Rangnick’s men sit three points adrift of the top four, with rivals Tottenham and Arsenal also holding games in hand.

The Spain international is in the finest form of his career at Anfield after excelling in Tuesday’s 4-0 thrashing of Manchester United. But he endured a difficult debut year at Anfield, missing 10 weeks with a knee injury caused by a Richarlison challenge in his first Merseyside derby, and struggling as a holding midfielder when Liverpool’s defensive injuries meant Fabinho had to play as a centre-back. Thiago was accused of slowing Liverpool’s game down and conceding too many free kicks and suggestions he did not fit in with their high-tempo football but Klopp said the former Bayern Munich and Barcelona player always had the footballing intelligence to adapt. “People were questioning if he suits our football?” said a surprised Klopp. “Thank God these people don’t make decisions. “If a player is calming a game down in moments due to a lot of reasons - one of them is just to have a look, or whatever - it is of course nothing we thought. “It is more important Thiago wanted to join us and he knew how we played. He is a real football person and thinks a lot about football. He knew how we played and he knew he we would fit in and we knew it as well. “It is always about being fit and staying fit and getting used to the slight differences to the former club, whatever these things are in different teams. Then you can go from there. Thiago had only one problem, he was injured and it started with an Everton game, to be honest. That didn’t help. It was never a question if he would suit us. We only signed him because we knew he would help us.” Naby Keita has also excelled of late after another injury-hit Liverpool career but Klopp harked back to their time in Germany to illustrate why he signed them. “When Naby was fit and Naby could get some rhythm he was always really good, unfortunately he could not get as much rhythm as he wished and as we wished in the past. Maybe that’s over now,” he said, knocking on the wood of the desk. “Hopefully the future is bright for him, he is a great player. The year before [Keita signed] it was Keita and Thiago were the two best midfielders in the Bundesliga by a distance. So to first get Naby and then Thiago, was obviously a good idea.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

The champions found their stride after a nervy first half to maintain the advantage in a compelling title duel with Liverpool by beating the Seagulls 3-0 at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday. The result was a strong response to Liverpool’s thrashing of Manchester United the previous night and restored City’s one-point lead at the summit with six games remaining. “Maybe (there were nerves) with the supporters but I felt we were doing all right,” said playmaker De Bruyne, who created two of City’s goals on what was his 300th appearance for the club. “Obviously it’s hard because everybody’s under pressure. We weren’t disturbed by the pressure, I would say. In the second half, when you score the (first) two goals it makes it easier and I think we did OK.” De Bruyne, back in the side after sitting out Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final loss to Liverpool with a knock, was instrumental in the victory. The Belgian charged through from deep to set up Riyad Mahrez’s opener early in the second half and teed up the third goal for Bernardo Silva after Phil Foden had doubled the lead. I’m maybe not the loudest but I try to play the way I play and I think I have a lot of passion and drive. The 30-year-old is enjoying a fine run of form having also scored important goals in recent games against Burnley, Atletico Madrid and Liverpool. He said: “I’m maybe not the loudest but I try to play the way I play and I think I have a lot of passion and drive when I’m in my actions. “I think I can help drive the team forward and I don’t have to be different in any way because I think this is my best way to give something to the team.” City will face Watford this weekend before turning their attention to next week’s Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid. Pep Guardiola’s side reached the last four after hanging onto an aggregate advantage with a gritty goalless draw in a fractious clash with Atletico Madrid in the Spanish capital last week. De Bruyne said: “It actually wasn’t good what we did but it didn’t have to be. Sometimes you have these games where it wasn’t a football game in the end. “We had to cope with the circumstances and we were a little bit lucky with it sometimes, but sometimes it goes that way. “There’s going to be hard moments because every team has a lot of quality and I don’t expect anything different against (Real) Madrid because the quality is there.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

Having come through the ranks at Arsenal, her childhood club, agreeing a new deal was something she was delighted to get over the line. “It feels amazing,” she said. “This contract means so much more to me and to my family than just it being a football contract. “It’s a commitment to the club and it’s a commitment to Arsenal, the community that it’s active in and to my life as a whole, because that’s what Arsenal is – it’s my life.” Arsenal currently sit a point behind leaders Chelsea in the Women’s Super League table ahead of their weekend trip to Everton. “Lotte has proven herself as an important player for us this season,” said head coach Jonas Eidevall. “So I’m delighted that she has extended her stay with the club.

The embassy was moved away from the city in mid-February, shortly before Vladimir Putin’s Russian forces launched a brutal invasion of the country. The prime minister said it was now safe for UK diplomats to return to Kyiv, after Ukrainian forces successfully fought off Russian advances on the capital. “The success of president Zelensky and the Ukrainian people in resisting Russian forces in Kyiv means that I can announce that we will very shortly reopen our embassy, nest week, in Ukraine’s capital city,” he said at a press conference in India.  Mr Johnson has not pressured his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi to strengthen his position against Putin over the invasion of Ukraine, Downing Street has conceded. No 10 said Mr Johnson did not raise India’s neutrality on the Russian invasion during his meeting in Delhi. His spokesperson said “he was not there to talk to another democratic country about what actions they should take”. More than a dozen countries have already sent diplomats back to Kyiv this month, after Moscow refocused its attention on the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. The EU reopened its diplomatic mission in Kyiv earlier this month, while Italy, France and Portugal have also sent officials to reopen embassies. “For Ukrainians, it’s symbolically important, definitely, that foreign countries are with them and supporting Ukraine with military aid and humanitarian aid but also with trying to continue embassy work as normally as possible,” one senior Eastern European diplomat told Foreign Policy.

On Ukraine, he said: “We emphasised an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine.” Boris Johnson also told negotiators working on a post-Brexit trade deal to get it brokered by Diwali in October.

Speaking of his own submission to Sir Graham Brady, Mark Harper told The Telegraph’s Chopper’s Politics podcast: “For me, I have been willing to give the PM the benefit of waiting to have the facts. He asked us earlier this year to do that, I thought that was a reasonable request. “I think deciding whether or not you want the PM is a big deal and you need all the facts at your disposal. He later added: “I have had quite a lot of colleagues indicate to me that they thought I was right. Some colleagues have already put letters in and not made it public. Mr Harper refused to specify the number of letters submitted behind closed doors or the names of any colleagues who had done so. He continued: “I think quite a lot of colleagues want to wait for all of the police work to be finished. Some of then will then want to see Sue Gray’s full report.”  The senior Tory MP also touted the local elections as a possible trigger for a wave of submissions to the committee.

All of this plays to Keir Starmer’s advantage.” Adam Forrest has the story: ‘The story is not going away’, says Sir John Curtice – pointing to further poll damage since PM’s fine  Labour’s shadow foreign secretary has called for a prime minister who “is taken seriously on the global stage” as support for Boris Johnson’s premiership wanes among the Tory party ranks. Tweeting this morning, David Lammy said: “Boris Johnson is in India in a desperate attempt to distract from his law-breaking and lies. “Britain deserves a Prime Minister who is taken seriously on the global stage.  “For this we need a leader who recognises that truth, decency and the rule of law matter.” Boris Johnson is set to use the Queen’s Speech to pick a Brexit fight in the European Union over the deal he signed with Brussels. After prolonged absence from the news agenda in Westminster, UK-EU relations will soon make a major comeback – as the prime minister seeks to move on from the Partygate scandal and energise his base.

Speaking on Sky News, the Conservative MP said: “There’s a recognition that every MP now realises it’s up to us to take ownership of this, because, I’m afraid, the absence of discipline, of focus and leadership in No 10 during that lockdown period has led to a huge breach of trust with the British people. “It’s causing such long-term damage to the party’s brand and that’s proving difficult to repair. “Can it be repaired in time for the next general election? “So it’s beholden upon all Conservative MPs then to take matters into their own hands, and I think, as I say, I think this is where things will go, particularly as we have more bad news to follow.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

The Ukraine war is a sore point in UK-India relations, as Delhi has maintained a neutral stance, condemning killings in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha but not the invasion itself and calling for diplomatic dialogue to end the conflict, and has continued to import military supplies from Russia. Mr Johnson vowed not to “lecture” Modi on his stance during his two-day visit, and he avoiding ruffling feathers by skating over the issue as he appeared alongside his host to face the press on Friday. In brief statements at state guest house Hyderabad House in Delhi, the pair – who took no questions from reporters and were not challenged on Mr Johnson’s travails over Partygate – announced progress in negotiations on a post-Brexit free trade agreement, with a deal to ease exports of UK medical devices to India. Mr Johnson revealed that four chapters of the deal have now been concluded, and said that when complete it would create “hundreds of thousands” of jobs by easing trade in British machinery and Indian rice and textiles. The PM said he wanted to accelerate talks, which enter their third round next week, telling negotiators to get the deal “done by Divali” on 24 October, while Mr Modi stuck to the end-of-2022 target originally set by the two sides. Mr Modi said that the pair had “emphasised an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and the use of dialogue and diplomacy for resolving issues”. The formulation effectively separates India from the West on Ukraine by dodging the issue of Russian blame for the violence. It conflicts starkly with Mr Johnson’s position that talks with Moscow are pointless because Vladimir Putin cannot be trusted, and the situation can only be resolved by the failure of the Russian president’s military adventure. Aides later said that Ukraine took up a “significant” part of talks stretching over just over an hour, but India’s foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said that Mr Johnson did not seek to put pressure on Modi to change his stance. And Mr Johnson chose not to pick a fight in public on the issue during his seven-minute statement, alluding only indirectly to the war as he hailed the close relationship between the UK and India, which he described with the Hindi phrase “khaas dost”, or “best friends”. Since he spoke with Modi via video link at last year’s G7 summit in Cornwall, “the threats of autocratic coercion have grown even further”, he said. “It’s therefore vital that we deepen our co-operation, including our shared interest in keeping the Indo-Pacific open and free.” In a mark of the UK’s efforts to wean Delhi off its reliance on Moscow for military supplies, the prime minister announced a “new and expanded” Defence and Security Partnership, including an Open General Export Licence for India, which will cut red tape and speed delivery of arms exports over the next decade. The licences have only previously been issued to Britain’s closest allies in the US and EU. The  UK will also promise to work with India to boost security across the five domains - land, sea, air, space and cyber. This will involve an offer of British know-how to support new Indian-designed and built fighter jets. And Britain will support India’s requirements for new technology to identify and respond to threats in the Indian Ocean. The pair also announced an agreement for Britain to support the development of hydrogen technology in India, as part of a push to find alternatives to Russian oil and gas to meet its energy needs.

(66, '/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-parties-local-elections-b2063191.html', 1, 'independent', 'Partygate is big problem for Tories at May elections, says poll guru', 'Boris Johnson’s Partygate scandal will be a major problem for the Conservatives at the May local elections, according to one of the country’s top political scientists. Sir John Curtice said polling had got worse for Tories since the prime minister was fined for his law-breaking birthday bash – saying the saga had “significantly damaged” his party. “The story is not going to go away, the story has now got legs again,” the polling guru told The Independent. “The opposition is just going to keep on talking about it. All of this plays to Keir Starmer’s advantage.” Professor Curtice said Labour had stretched its lead over the Tories by three points since Mr Johnson was handed a fixed penalty notice by the Metropolitan Police – leading to an average Labour poll lead of eight points. Asked if Partygate will be major problem come the elections on 5 May, Prof Curtice said: “Yes. The government can keep saying we’ve got these other issues. But they are getting bad press over cost of living. And Ukraine is a mixed blessing.” The Strathclyde University professor added: “There has never been evidence of a rallying factor [for the Tories] from Ukraine, and the government is getting terrible press over the visa refugee policy.” However, Prof Curtice said much of the public outrage over Partygate has been “largely baked in” since December and January, when the most significant shift in the polls occurred. “The latest YouGov poll shows 78 per cent think [Mr Johnson] lied. They thought that in January,” Sir John said. “Stories over the next couple weeks will just reinforce those views.” The expert added: “My view is that Partygate has significantly damaged the Conservatives’ standing, though it has not led to the collapse in the Conservative vote.” One recent study predicted that the Tories could lose up to 810 council seats at next month’s elections. Around 5,000 seats are up for grabs at local elections taking place across England, Wales and Scotland, while Northern Ireland is voting on the Stormont assembly. The Electoral Calculus and Find Out Now study, based on extensive polling in England and Wales, also estimated that Labour could gain up to 835 seats. However, Prof Curtice said seat forecasting for local elections was a “mug’s game”. But the polling guru said he did expect the Tories to lose a lot of council seats at elections in Scotland, while Labour may seize control of more councils in London – including Barnet and Wandsworth. Even if Mr Johnson survives a push on his leadership by restless Tory backbenchers after the local elections next month, he faces another major test with the Wakefield by-election. Tory MP Stephen Hammond has suggested that contest, now expected to take place in June, could be the final straw for Mr Johnson. On the key test in “red wall” territory, the former minister said: “If we don’t [win], there might be some thought about what we need to do to reassure those voters that came to us for the first time in 2019.” Senior Tory MP Mark Harper – who has sent a letter of no-confidence letter to the 1922 Committee – said he expected 54 letters needed to trigger a vote to be submitted before parliament’s summer recess in July. Prof Curtice said: “I think we’ve reached a point where the opposition probably thinks that Boris Johnson staying on is to their advantage. The Labour message is the ‘Tories want to hang onto a lawbreaker’ and they will keep on repeating it.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(67, '/news/uk/politics/brexit-northern-ireland-queens-speech-boris-johnson-eu-b2063157.html', 1, 'independent', 'Boris Johnson set to use Queen’s Speech to pick Brexit fight with EU', 'Boris Johnson is set to use the Queen\'s Speech to pick a Brexit fight in the European Union over the deal he signed with Brussels. After prolonged absence from the news agenda in Westminster, UK-EU relations will soon make a major comeback – as the prime minister seeks to move on from the Partygate scandal and energise his base. The government\'s legislative programme is reportedly to include powers for ministers to scrap the Northern Ireland protocol, a key part of the agreement Mr Johnson negotiated with Brussels. But the prime minister now says the agreement is not working and that it should be reformed to make life easier for Northern Ireland. Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg told a parliamentary committee on Wednesday: \"There a lot of commentary that says: ‘Well, we signed it and therefore surely we should accept it lock, stock and barrel.’ That’s absolute nonsense.\" Now the Financial Times reports that Mr Johnson and foreign secretary Liz Truss have in principle signed off plans to bring forward a Northern Ireland Bill early in the next parliamentary session, which begins next month. That bill would give ministers the power to deactivate parts of the protocol in British law, including border checks across the Irish Sea. A UK government spokesperson said that no decisions had yet been taken and that \"our overriding priority continues to be the protection of peace and stability in Northern Ireland\". But asked about the plan on LBC radio on Friday morning Northern Ireland minister Conor Burns said: \"We don\'t talk about what\'s in the Queen\'s speech before the Queen\'s speech has been delivered, that would be grossly inappropriate.  \"What I would say is we have been clear as far back as last July, the prime minister said, that we believe that threshold for trial for triggering Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol had been reached. \"There is significant societal disruption in Northern Ireland due to the way the protocol is being implemented. There is a sense that people in Northern Ireland are a people set apart.\" He added that the agreement \"is not working as it was intended to work\" and that \"it is absolutely right that if the European Commission will not move will not look at practical solutions to make the protocol less invasive, less bureaucratic then the United Kingdom [will]\". Mr Burn added: \"We have been very clear with the Commission that ultimately if there isn\'t movement, if there isn\'t a political willingness to engage in changing the protocol to make its implementation and application work more effectively, then the United Kingdom retains the right – as by the way laid down under Article 16, which says the application has protocol leads to serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are likely to persist or diversions of trade, the Union or the UK may take unilateral and appropriate safeguarding measures – that may be what we have to do.\" PA ANP/AFP/Getty AFP/Getty Reuters AFP/Getty Reuters AFP/Getty AFP/Getty Reuters AFP via Getty Images AFP/Getty Reuters AP AFP/Getty EPA Press service of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine via Reuters AFP via Getty Images AFP/Getty AFP/Getty AFP/Getty AFP via Getty EPA EPA AFP/Getty AFP/Getty EPA Reuters AFP/Getty Reuters EPA EPA AFP/Getty EPA AP AFP/Getty AP AP EPA AFP/Getty Getty EPA EPA AFP/Getty AFP via Getty Images AFP via Getty Images EPA Reuters OIS/IOC/AFP/Getty AFP/Getty Reuters Under the Northern Ireland Brexit protocol, Northern Ireland remains in the EU single market and customs area – a provision agreed by both sides to prevent a hard border from being required between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Both sides wanted to achieve this aim to preserve the Good Friday Agreement and peace process. But the agreement means there are some checks on trade and extra frictions between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, because the government wanted to take Britain out of the customs union and single market under its hard Brexit policy.  The agreement has general support across Northern Ireland in opinion polls but is unpopular with some in the unionist community, who believe on ideological grounds that Northern Ireland should not be treated differently from the rest of the United Kingdom. Recent polling from October 2021 conducted by LucidTalk to Queen’s University Belfast revealed 52 per cent of respondents believe the post-Brexit arrangement to be a “good thing”, up from 43 per cent in June that year. Asked whether the UK would be justified in triggering Article 16 53 per cent of respondents said no and 39 per cent who responded yes.

The prime minister is struggling with growing unease among Tory MPs as he now faces a Commons investigation into whether he lied to parliament over the No 10 parties. Tory MP Conor Burns shared Mr Johnson’s “frustration” with the new probe, saying: “This is going to be the most looked at event, possibly, since the Second World War.” The Northern Ireland minister told Sky News: “He has nothing to fear. He’s looking forward to this ending, he’s looking forward to drawing this to a conclusion, for it to be examined fully so we can move on.” Mr Burns – the minister who said Mr Johnson had been “ambushed by cake” at his birthday bash – said there was “no question of the prime minister going”. The loyal ally said Mr Johnson remained confident that he would be cleared – saying he believed that the PM statements on parties had been “faithful, genuine and true”. The minister added: “He remains confident that when people can see the full context of what happened it will be clear that he was straightforward … He said to the House in good faith that he believed the rules were followed.” The privileges committee investigation into Mr Johnson’s remarks is likely to trigger the release of demining photos of rule-breaking gatherings. If the inquiry finds MPs were “knowingly” misled, he will be expected to resign for breaching the ministerial code. Mr Johnson shared his frustration with ongoing questions over Partygate. “What I don’t want is for this thing to just go on and on and on,” he told Channel 4 News while in India. Senior Tory MP Mark Harper – who has sent a letter of no-confidence letter to the Tory backbenchers’ 1922 Committee – said he expected 54 letters needed to trigger a vote to be submitted before parliament’s summer recess in July. “I think my colleagues will have enough evidence to make a decision,” the ex-chief whip told The Telegraph. We can resolve this matter then, and later we can give the country the fresh leadership it deserves.” Mr Harper also said he was “very confident that we’re going to see photographs” from Downing Street parties. Fellow Tory MP Tobias Ellwood, who has called on Mr Johnson to quit, said a growing number of backbenchers were “troubled” by his leadership. “It’s now when, not if, a vote of confidence takes place,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. The defence committee chair also told Sky News: “We must stop drinking that Kool-Aid that’s encouraging us to think this is all going to disappear ... More and more MPs believe it’s time the leadership baton is passed on.” Meanwhile, Mr Burns has said the government will “take remedial action” to scrap the Northern Ireland Protocol “if there isn’t movement” from EU. The minister refused to be drawn on a report by the Financial Times that the government is now preparing legislation giving them sweeping powers to tear up the protocol. However, Mr Burns said it is clear that the protocol is not working in the way that “was intended” and the government already has powers under Article 16 of the protocol allowing it to suspend elements of it. Asked why the government signed the protocol as part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, Mr Burns said: “We signed it because of some of the guarantees that were in it.”  Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

After Downing Street staff vetoed the Mi-17 chopper, a US-built Chinook was flown from an Indian Air Force base six hours away to do the job. Citing senior protocol officials in the Indian government, The Times of India said Mr Johnson’s unwillingness to use the Russian craft was made clear by No 10 staff making preparations for the trip three days in advance. It is understood they said that the use of a Russian craft would not be appropriate during the current sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine. The helicopter ride was planned to transport the PM from Gujarati state capital Ahmedabad to a nearby JCB plant and back shortly after his arrival in the country on Thursday. The 30-seater Chinook was brought in from the IAF base at Chandigarh on Wednesday to take Mr Johnson on the 20-minute flight to the factory in Halol. It is understood that the PM - who had just completed a 10-hour journey from London - joined the pilot in the cockpit of the craft, and briefly dozed off during the flight.

Mark Harper – who has sent a letter of no-confidence letter to the Tory backbenchers’ 1922 Committee – said he expected 54 letters needed to trigger a vote to be submitted before parliament’s summer recess in July. “I think my colleagues will have enough evidence to make a decision,” the ex-chief whip told The Telegraph podcast. We can resolve this matter then, and later we can give the country the fresh leadership it deserves.” Asked if the Tory vote on Mr Johnson’s leadership would happen “before the summer break”, Mr Harper said: “Yes.” Mr Harper also said he was “very confident that we’re going to see photographs” from Downing Street parties – which some expect will trigger a flurry of letters to the 1922 Committee chair. Fellow Tory MP Tobias Ellwood, who has called on Mr Johnson to quit, said a growing number of backbenchers were “troubled” by his leadership. “It’s now when, not if, a vote of confidence takes place,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. The defence committee chair also told Sky News: “We must stop drinking that Kool-Aid that’s encouraging us to think this is all going to disappear ... More and more MPs believe it’s time the leadership baton is passed on.” Mr Johnson faces the humiliation of a Commons inquiry into whether he lied to parliament over the No 10 parties, after a revolt by Tory MPs forced him to abandon an attempt to kick it into the long grass. The privileges committee investigation is likely to trigger the release of demining photos of rule-breaking gatherings. If the inquiry finds MPs were “knowingly” misled, Mr Johnson will be expected to resign for breaching the ministerial code. Despite the growing pressure, Johnson loyalist Conor Burns – the minister who said he had been “ambushed by cake” – said on Friday: “There’s no question of the prime minister going.” The Northern Ireland minister told Sky News: “He has nothing to fear.

Mr Johnson shared his frustration with ongoing questions over Partygate. “What I don’t want is for this thing to just go on and on and on,” he told Channel 4 News while in India. “I think there’s got to be a way of drawing a line under it.”  Former minister Steve Baker became the latest minister to call on Mr Johnson to resign – telling the Commons on Thursday that “the gig’s up”. Mr Baker’s call to resign was “very significant”, said Lord Barwell, former chief of staff to Theresa May. The Tory peer told LBC: “If I was still working in No 10, I would be pretty worried about that intervention.” William Wragg – who has demanded a confidence vote – also urged his fellow Tory MPs to act on Mr Johnson’s leadership of the party. “We must stop delegating and delaying our political judgement,” he pleaded. Mr Harper said: “Colleagues have got to decide they want to go into the election, with Boris Johnson leading the Conservative Party. If they do, they can just sit on their hands.” Though 54 Tory MPs must submit letters of no confidence to trigger a leadership vote, a majority of the party’s MPs – around 180 – must vote against Mr Johnson to remove him from office. Mr Burns hit out at Tory MPs calling for Mr Johnson’s resignation, saying they “never really supported” him. The minister told the Today programme: “If the prime minister stepped off Westminster Bridge and walked on top of the water they would say he couldn’t swim – that is a fact.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(71, '/news/uk/politics/rwanda-asylum-seekers-uk-priti-patel-b2059064.html', 1, 'independent', 'UK’s Rwanda asylum plan against international law, says UN', 'The UK’s proposal to send migrants who arrive in Britain unlawfully to Rwanda is “unacceptable” and a breach of international law, the UN’s refugee agency said. The Government announced this week it plans to provide failed asylum seekers, including those crossing the Channel in small boats, with a one-way ticket to Rwanda, where they will have the right to apply to live in the African country. Gillian Triggs, an assistant secretary-general at the UNHCR, said the agency “strongly condemns outsourcing the primary responsibility to consider the refugee status”, as laid out in the scheme put forward by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Priti Patel. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s World At One programme, the former president of the Australian Human Rights Commission said the policy was a “troubling development”, particularly in the light of countries taking in millions of Ukrainian refugees displaced by the conflict in eastern Europe. Put to her that Australia had effectively deployed a similar tactic to cut migration numbers, Ms Triggs said: “My point is, just as the Australian policy is an egregious breach of international law and refugee law and human rights law, so too is this proposal by the United Kingdom Government. “It is very unusual, very few states have tried this, and the purpose is primarily deterrent – and it can be effective, I don’t think we’re denying that. “But what we’re saying at the UN refugee agency is that there are much more legally effective ways of achieving the same outcome.” She said attempting to “shift responsibility” for asylum seekers arriving in Britain was “really unacceptable”. Ms Triggs pointed out that Israel had attempted to send Eritrean and Sudanese refugees to Rwanda, but that they “simply left the country and started the process all over again”. “In other words, it is not actually a long-term deterrent,” she added. Tom Pursglove, minister for justice and tackling illegal migration, said on Friday that the policy was “in line” with the UK’s legal obligations. However, he accepted that it would be “difficult” to implement the plan to remove asylum seekers to Rwanda, with the Government braced for legal challenges. He told Times Radio: “I think what is also really important to make (clear) in dealing with that issue is that, at all times, we act in accordance with our international obligations, the ECHR (European Convention on Human Rights) and the refugee convention. “We are absolutely confident that our policies are in line with that and entirely compliant, which by extension would mean that those legal challenges would be without merit. “But it will be difficult, there will be challenges.” Mr Pursglove also suggested during broadcast interviews that other countries in Europe were considering emulating the UK’s Rwandan policy, which he described as a “world first”. He said there was a “moral imperative” to crush the business model of human traffickers and avoid a tragedy like that seen in November, when a dinghy sank in the English Channel, drowning dozens of migrants heading to Britain. “The point I would make is that what is cruel and inhumane is allowing evil criminal gangs to take advantage of people, to take their money, to put them in small boats, often with force, including women and children, to put them in the Channel with all the risks that that presents to human life,” he told ITV’s Good Morning Britain. “We simply cannot allow that to happen, which is why we’ve introduced the new plan for immigration to stop these illegal journeys.” The minister also argued that in the “longer term” the scheme would save Britain money, with almost £5 million per day currently spent on accommodating those arriving in the country. Former Tory international development secretary Andrew Mitchell questioned that, saying calculations had been made that suggested it would be cheaper to put those arriving in Britain up at The Ritz hotel in London’s Mayfair for a year. Ms Patel agreed a £120 million economic deal while in Kigali on Thursday, and money for each removal is expected to follow, with reports suggesting each migrant sent to Rwanda is expected to set British taxpayers back between £20,000 and £30,000. The Times said this would cover accommodation both before and after the journey, as well as the cost of a seat on the flight itself. The Royal Navy has been put in charge of policing the Channel as part of the reform package announced this week, in a bid to curb the number of small boat crossings. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said that, in the 24-hour period up to 11.59pm on Thursday April 14, the navy detected 562 migrants in 14 small boats in the strait. The department said it did not believe any migrants arrived “on their own terms in a small boat” on Thursday, but on Good Friday women, children and single men were among hundreds of people brought ashore. Naval ships were spotted towing empty dinghies used by people smugglers back to the UK after those on board were offloaded on to boats operated by Border Force, which is part of the Home Office.

(191, '/sport/football/bayern-munich-borussia-dortmund-copa-del-rey-b2062502.html', 2, 'independent', 'Copa del Rey final and Der Klassiker headline Europe’s top games', 'While the Premier League indulges in a Merseyside derby and a couple of big battles for European spots, there’s plenty on the line around Europe too this weekend. It’s not only the continental giants under the spotlight either, as we start in Spain where a trophyless run lasting 17 years might be coming to an end. These days, the Spanish Super Cup is a four-team competition, pretty much guaranteeing that two, if not three, names each time will be wildly predictable. After all, only twice since 2010 has a team other than Barcelona, Real Madrid or Atletico Madrid won the Copa del Rey, and it’s twice in 22 years in La Liga itself. Which makes this year’s final, taking place on Saturday night at the Estadio Olimpico in Sevilla, all the more intriguing, open and very unpredictable to call. Real Betis face Valencia, the teams currently fifth and 10th respectively in the top flight, neither one in impressive form and yet both sensing the opportunity for glory. For the Andalucians, it’s just three wins in 12 across all competitions coming into this game, but also only one defeat in seven - a Tuesday night loss to Elche when they rotated ahead of the final. As for Valencia, they’ve won four of 13, mildly better, but have lost the last two, so mildly worse. You figure it out. Of course, the primary figure here is none other than veteran winger Joaquin, the 40-year-old legend who has played more games for Betis than any player in history and is in his second spell at the club. In between those two stints came five years at Valencia, of course. The last time Betis won the Copa del Rey, back in 2005, Joaquin was in the starting line-up as a lightning-quick youngster. Three years later he was an unused sub for Los Che as they also lifted the trophy - the only two pieces of silverware in his long and iconic career. Few would bet against one final chapter being written before he retires this summer. Usually when we get to this stage of the season, the title is almost wrapped up and the two biggest clubs in Germany meet, if there is a player who has already wrapped up a summer transfer there’s a high probability they are swapping BVB for FCB. Not so this time, with Niklas Sule set to start in defence for the Bavarians, but having already announced a free transfer switch to Signal Iduna Park come the end of the campaign, as he looks to rediscover his best form and fitness which has somewhat deserted him since a long-term 2020 knee injury.  Though a fairly regular performer under Julian Nagelsmann, he isn’t a guaranteed starter for Bayern and has even featured out of position at right-back at times - the move to Dortmund, who are also expected to confirm the signing of Freiburg centre-back Nico Schlotterbeck soon, could give him a new lease of life and a lot of motivation to wrest the title away from the Allianz Arena, after five years of trying to keep it there. With nine points between the teams and only four games left to play, Bayern can seal a 10th straight title against their biggest rivals if they take victory here, while Dortmund can at least make them sweat a little longer if they instead triumph on enemy soil. And, of course, there’s the on-rumbling Erling Haaland rumours to navigate, a minor one of which suggests he’ll be the replacement for Robert Lewandowski - if the 32-goal top scorer makes this one his last in Germany. Jose Mourinho’s AS Roma and their city rivals Lazio aren’t involved in the title race in Italy this year in a direct way, but this weekend they’ll have a huge say in who goes on to lift the trophy. A Champions League spot isn’t yet out of reach for Roma if they have a great end to the campaign, but it’s a big ask to go to reigning champions Inter Milan and win, especially when the slightest slip-up from Simone Inzaghi’s men might mean losing their status as the league’s finest - to their own city rivals, no less. Inzaghi’s old side Lazio are the next obstacle for AC Milan, however, and after a couple of recent draws they can ill-afford any more mistakes. With five matches to play it’s the Rossoneri who lead the way, two points clear of Inter and two further back to Napoli, but Inter have played a game fewer and can take top spot back if they win it in midweek...assuming they haven’t already fallen off the pace against Mourinho and Co, of course. The tightest title race in mainland Europe this season no doubt still has a twist or two to come.

(192, '/sport/football/paul-pogba-man-utd-injury-career-b2063292.html', 2, 'independent', 'Pogba could have played his last game for Manchester United', 'Ralf Rangnick has suggested Paul Pogba has played his last match for Manchester United. The 29-year-old came through the Old Trafford youth set-up and rejoined the club in 2016 following a successful stint at Juventus for a then world-record fee. But Pogba’s return has not worked out how either party would want and the World Cup winner looks set to leave United this summer when his contract expires. There is little sign of him agreeing a new deal, meaning the 10 minutes he managed before limping off with a calf injury in Tuesday’s 4-0 meek loss at Liverpool are likely to be his last for the club. Rangnick said: “With Paul, as it seems after the scan we did the day before yesterday, it is very unlikely he will play until the end of the season again.” Asked if Pogba has played his final match for United, Rangnick said: “The doctor told me it will take four weeks minimum for him to recover and the last game is the end of May. “I don’t think that it is very likely that he will be able to play again.” Pogba is one of a number of players that are set to leave during a summer of change that will be overseen by newly-appointed manager Erik ten Hag. The Ajax boss will start as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s permanent successor in the summer, having signed a deal until 2025 with the option of a further year. “We don’t know each other in person, we haven’t met as yet in person,” Rangnick said of Ten Hag. “But from what I’ve seen him doing both at Bayern Munich when he was the under-23 coach and at Ajax now, I like his football. “I am pretty positive with a full pre-season, with having a chance to build and mould his own staff, also a new team, which is obvious – we will have a new team. “With a full pre-season, I am pretty sure we will see a different team and an improvement on the pitch. I knew that Erik was one of the candidates the board spoke to. “Obviously I told them, at least from what I have seen and known from people who had worked with Erik, that I think he would be a good choice. “I still believe that he is a very good choice. And all the other things, we haven’t had time so far to speak about.” Rangnick’s two-year consultancy role is a key topic but the immediate focus is on Saturday’s crunch clash at top-four rivals Arsenal. United cannot afford to lose any further ground following their Anfield embarrassment, where a number of players were missing through injury and Cristiano Ronaldo was given compassionate leave. Rangnick confirmed the frontman will be back along with Raphael Varane in the capital, where Scott McTominay is fit to start having been named as an emergency substitute at Liverpool. Harry Maguire is also available with the Manchester United captain’s spokesman saying he is preparing “for this weekend’s fixture as normal” after receiving a bomb threat on Thursday. Rangnick said: “I haven’t seen him because I only got to know about this terrible, terrible thing yesterday afternoon. Since then I haven’t been able to speak with him. “But again this is another bad sign of the crazy world we’re living in. “Obviously I feel very sorry for Harry that he had that terrible experience, but he knows that we’re all behind him – the club, everybody, the players, his team-mates.

(193, '/f1/lewis-hamilton-chelsea-takeover-serena-williams-b2063259.html', 2, 'independent', 'Hamilton says role in buying Chelsea would be the ‘ultimate dream’ ', 'Lewis Hamilton has confirmed he has joined a consortium of investors bidding to buy Chelsea and says playing a part in the takeover of the club would be the “ultimate dream”.  The seven-time Formula One world champion has explained the “great opportunity” to back Sir Martin Broughton’s bid to buy the club, which has also been joined by 23-time tennis grand slam champion Serena Williams.  Hamilton says he is motivated by helping Chelsea “do better moving forwards” and is appealed by the challenge of turning the Premier League club in to a “profit-making organisation”.  The 37-year-old added that he had held discussions with Broughton, who is leading one of takeover three bids following the sanctioning of Roman Abramovich by the UK Government, to continue Chelsea’s work in making an “impact” in the community.  Hamilton also revealed how he and Williams became involved in the bid, which faces opposition from rival consortiums led by Boston Celtics owner Steve Pagliuca and LA Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly.  “Chelsea is one of the biggest teams in the world,” Hamilton said ahead of this weekend’s Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix . “When I heard about the opportunity, I was like wow, this is a great opportunity to be part of something so great. “Sir Martin took time to speak to me on the phone and explain to me his and his team’s goals if they were to win the bid, which was incredibly exciting and very much aligned with my values.” Hamilton and Williams are friends and the 40-year-old American is already an investor in Los Angeles’ Angel City FC, who play in the NWSL in the United States. “We spoke about it,” Hamilton said. “I told her I was going to be involved and she was happy to join.” Hamilton, who said he grew up as an Arsenal fan and had trials for his Stevenage, his local team, as he revealed what attracted him to joining Broughton’s consortium. On Thursday, Hamilton’s rival Max Verstappen poked fun at the idea of an Arsenal fan joining a bid to buy Chelsea.  “I have been a football fan since I was a kid. I played in the school team every year in my childhood and I have been to numerous games,” Hamilton said. “When I was young, I wanted to fit in and all the kids supported different teams. I remember switching between teams and my sister punching me and saying you have to support Arsenal, so then I became a supporter of Arsenal. “But my uncle Terry is a big Blues fan and I have been to so many games with him to watch Arsenal and Chelsea play. I wanted to be the best player I could be and play for a team. I was trying to tryout for Stevenage Borough but I ended up in the racing space. I could only have dreamed of being part of a team - and that is the ultimate dream.” Hamilton was also asked about the finances of his pledge, which is believed to be in the region of £10m, and whether it can be considered to be an investment considering Chelsea’s latest accounts revealed an annual loss of around £150m.  “Naturally it is never the idea of an investment [to lose money],” Hamilton said. “I want to be part of something, manage this team moving forward, improve that and make sure that doesn’t happen by slowly decreasing those losses and turn it into a profit-making organisation. “That is going to take a lot of work and there are lots of moving parts. I don’t have the strategy for that at the moment. We have not won the bid so I am sure that will all come afterwards. “But the consortium is a consortium of lifetime Chelsea fans and others that have come later to it like myself. There is not one part of that consortium that has a mindset of losing. I really think Chelsea already has a winning mindset but we can do better moving forwards.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

Salah will enter the final year of his Liverpool contract next season and talks are ongoing over extending his five-year stay at Anfield.  The Egypt forward is Liverpool’s top scorer this season and reached 30 goals for the campaign with his two strikes against Manchester United on Tuesday.  In an interview with Four Four Two, Salah said he wants to stay at Liverpool but confirmed there have been no developments in his contract standoff ahead of the closing stages of the season.  Liverpool are in contention for an unprecedented quadruple and manager Jurgen Klopp said earlier this month that he was “happy” with Salah’s contract situation.  But the 29-year-old expressed doubts over his future as negotiations continue. “I don’t know, I have one year left,” Salah said when asked if he will remain at Liverpool at the end of his current deal.  “I think the fans know what I want, but in the contract it’s not everything about the money at all. So I don’t know, I can’t tell you exactly. I have one year left and the fans know what I want.” Salah broke a mini-drought of six games by scoring two against United  He added: “This club means a lot to me. I’ve enjoyed my football here more than anywhere, I gave the club everything and everybody saw that. I’ve had a lot of unbelievable moments here, winning trophies, individual goals, individual trophies. It’s like a family here.  “I’m not worried [about the situation], I don’t let myself worry about something. The season didn’t finish yet, so let’s finish it in the best possible way. That’s the most important thing. Then in the last year, we’re going to see what’s going to happen.” Salah turns 30 in June and Liverpool have also yet to sign fellow forwards Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino to new deals. Mane turned 30 earlier this month while Firmino will be 31 this year.  However the Premier League’s top scorer said that age will not be a factor in the negotiations, pointing to the performances of other top forwards such as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo late in their careers, as well as the goalscoring records of Karim Benzema and Robert Lewandowski this season.  “Now you can see that with players, all of them extend their careers,” Salah said. “You can see the top, top players always after 32, 33, you can see a lot of them – Lewandowski, Benzema, Messi, Ronaldo, Zlatan [Ibrahimovic], a lot of players. All of them perform really well after 30, so I’m not concerned about that.”  Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

A crowd of 91,648 packed into the Nou Camp as Ballon d’Or winner Alexia Putellas scored twice to put Barca in complete control of the tie. That figure surpassed the 91,553 fans who turned out for the Catalan club’s quarter-final win over rivals Real Madrid at the same stadium. Aitana Bonmati gave the reigning champions a third-minute lead before further strikes from Caroline Graham Hansen, Jennifer Hermoso and Putellas made it 4-0 at half-time. The German club briefly reduced the deficit through Jill Roord’s 70th-minute finish but the dominant hosts had the final say as Putellas converted from the penalty spot five minutes from time to claim her second of the evening. Spain midfielder Putellas now leads the scoring charts in this year’s tournament with 10 goals. Barca, who registered 33 attempts at goal, will seek to complete the job next Saturday at the Volkswagen Arena. The winners of the tie will face the victors of the all-French semi-final between Lyon and Paris St Germain. The final is scheduled to take place on Saturday, May 21 at Juventus Stadium in Turin.

Following their 2-1 quarter final first-leg defeat on April 7, the Italian side’s captain Lorenzo Pellegrini said Santos had been attacked, while Knutsen accused a Roma goalkeeping coach of grabbing him by the throat. The Independent obtained video footage of the incident after it had been submitted to Uefa as evidence.  European football’s governing body had provisionally suspended the duo and added on Friday that they had initiated disciplinary proceedings due to the coaches violating the general principles of conduct. “The Uefa Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body (CEDB) will decide on the matter in due course,” Uefa said in a statement. Bodo had said that they planned to report the incident to the police. Roma won the second leg 4-0 to seal a 5-2 aggregate victory.

(225, '/sport/football/thomas-tuchel-the-blues-premier-league-timo-werner-stamford-bridge-b2063373.html', 2, 'independent', 'Tuchel tells Chelsea not to get superstitious over home form', 'Thomas Tuchel has told his Chelsea players not to let superstition cloud their bid to boost their ailing home form. Chelsea slipped to a third-straight home defeat in all competitions for the first time since 1993 with Wednesday’s 4-2 Stamford Bridge loss to Arsenal. The Blues have slumped to ninth in the home-form standings after seven wins, five draws and three league losses. Chelsea remain on course for a third-place Premier League finish though, with Tuchel’s men second in the away-day rankings thanks to 11 wins, three draws and just two defeats on their travels. The Blues host West Ham in another London derby on Sunday, with Tuchel admitting a fragility in his side’s home performances – but also warning against an overreaction. Asked if now is the time to restore Stamford Bridge’s fortress factor, Tuchel replied: “Obviously, I didn’t know those numbers but it’s obvious that we are behind and that’s very unusual, and it’s very unusual also for me in my experience not only here but over the last years. “It’s unusual and I don’t know what it is, if it was just the one thing, we would switch dressing rooms or take another hotel or something like this. But that would may be more superstition than anything else. “I have no solution but it’s also not the level that we want to produce in home games. It’s a bit fragile at the moment I have to say, it was against Brentford and against Real Madrid. “It was straight away better in the next three games. And then we had a good start to the Arsenal match actually; I was very happy with the energy and the quality. “But then you have the feeling of ‘oh no, not again’, and once you have this feeling it’s hard to get rid of it. “Sometimes it’s not even a problem tactically or of shape, or sometimes it’s due to pure quality that you have to accept sometimes from the opponent. “But it can be very hard to separate, whether this was our mistake, was it not enough or was it simply very difficult to defend this chance. And it can happen that a feeling creeps in that you don’t want to have. “Normally you want to feel in a home game that you can feel still capable of coming back no matter what happens. But now it’s a bit different but very hard to argue, because it seems obvious we’ve had a row of three home games with very similar results that we absolutely don’t like. “And it’s now the job to convince the players to keep on going, the supporters to keep on pushing and to hang in positive, because we have a lot to build on, we have a lot to rely on and also to trust. “So don’t get superstitious now, and don’t believe in things that maybe are not there. But it is another challenge on top of the others.” Don\'t get superstitious now, and don\'t believe in things that maybe are not there. But it is another challenge on top of the others Mateo Kovacic will miss Sunday’s clash with ankle ligament trouble, with Toni Rudiger also ruled out through a groin issue. Eddie Nketiah’s double, a neat Emile Smith Rowe finish and a late Bukayo Saka penalty undid Chelsea against the Gunners in midweek. Timo Werner and Cesar Azpilicueta were on target as Chelsea twice equalised in the first half, but Andreas Christensen’s under-hit back-pass to gift Nketiah the opener lingered long after the game had finished. Tuchel criticised the state of the Stamford Bridge pitch straight after the Arsenal loss, and on Friday admitted Chelsea are still looking into the standard of their home surface. Asked for the specific issue with the pitch, Tuchel replied: “I don’t know, I’m not a specialist on it and we’re looking into highest level in every department and I know everybody is trying hard. “I said it because the first goal was from Andreas but it was because of a funny bounce of the ball and we had more of them in the game. “It was awkward to play and calculate the speed and bounce of the ball. So it’s like this, that was it, but I know everybody’s working hard in every department to provide the best level. And so we try and keep on going. “We were struggling a bit with the timing of the renewal (of the turf) this season, then this leads to a bit of the problem. The pitch wasn’t where it should and could be at the beginning of the season. “We felt it and saw it at away matches. This was a funny bounce given to the quality of the pitch at this moment, and it cost us.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(226, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-61190310', 1, 'bbc', 'UK embassy in Kyiv to reopen next week, says PM', 'By Andre Rhoden-PaulBBC News This video can not be played The British embassy in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv will reopen next week, Boris Johnson has announced. Ambassador Melinda Simmons said she was \"heading back\" after leaving when Russia invaded. The prime minister also said there was a \"realistic possibility\" the Russian bombardment would continue until the end of next year. Mr Johnson added the UK was looking at sending tanks to support Poland as it supplies Ukraine with heavy weaponry. The prime minister made the embassy announcement at a news conference in Delhi, where he has been holding talks with Indian leader Narendra Modi.  It comes after Russia withdrew forces from around Kyiv when it failed to seize the capital, and launched an assault on the eastern Donbas region. Mr Johnson visited Kyiv earlier this month to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky, following a pledge to give £100m worth of weapons to Ukraine.  Taking questions from reporters, the prime minister said intelligence assessments that the Russian assault could continue to the end of next year, and end with a Russian victory, were plausible. He said Russian President Vladimir Putin has \"a huge army\" but \"he has a very difficult political position because he\'s made a catastrophic blunder\". Mr Johnson said: \"The only option he now has, really, is to continue to try to use his appalling, grinding approach driven by artillery, trying to grind the Ukrainians down. \"I think no matter what military superiority Vladimir Putin may be able to bring to bear in the next few months, and I agree it could be a long period, he will not be able to conquer the spirit of the Ukrainian people.\" The prime minister said he was looking at what the UK could do to \"backfill\" weapons in countries, such as Poland, \"who may want to send heavier weaponry to help defend the Ukrainians\".  \"We\'re looking at sending tanks to Poland to help them, as they send some of their T-72s [tanks] to Ukraine and other steps like that,\" Mr Johnson said.  Sending British main battle tanks to Poland, if confirmed, would be a very significant move. As one senior British Army officer put it, it raises the UK\'s commitment to Ukraine by a further notch but also increases the chances of Britain - and Nato - eventually becoming co-belligerents in this conflict.  The tanks, which the Ministry of Defence says would be Challenger 2 main battle tanks, would be intended to \"backfill\" for Poland\'s T72 tanks, which it is sending directly to Ukraine. There are no plans to send British tanks or crews into action in Ukraine.  Until very recently Nato countries have been reluctant to supply heavy weaponry to the Ukrainians for fear of antagonising President Putin and risking an all-out European war that puts Nato forces into direct conflict with Russia.  But with each reported Russian atrocity that is revealed, notably in Bucha, these Western inhibitions have melted away.  Poland is sending tanks, Slovakia has sent its S300 air defence missiles and the US is sending powerful, long-range 155mm artillery.  For Ukraine\'s army, outnumbered and outgunned in the eastern Donbas region, such help cannot come quickly enough.  But President Putin has made no secret of his irritation at Nato\'s assistance to his enemy and he used this week\'s test-launch of a nuclear-capable missile to remind the West of Russia\'s massive arsenal of strategic nuclear weapons. In the long term, Mr Johnson said he believed Western nations would respond to demands from Ukraine to guarantee the country\'s security against future attacks. He said this would not replicate the Article 5 guarantee for Nato members - in which an attack on one country is treated as an attack on all members. But instead, Western allies would offer pledges to provide weaponry, training and intelligence-sharing, the prime minister said. \"I hope it will enable the Ukrainians to offer deterrents by denial and to make sure their territory is so fortified as to be impregnable in the future to further attack from Russia,\" he said. \"Deterrence by denial\" is a term in military thinking which means seeking to put off an aggressor by making their attack infeasible or unlikely to succeed, rather than through the threat of retaliation. Mr Johnson added that he backed ministers if they chose to visit the embassy.  European diplomats have also been returning to the capital.

After meeting his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi in Delhi, the PM vowed to get an agreement \"done\" by Diwali in late October. Ahead of fresh negotiations next week, he said a deal could take UK-India trade to \"a whole new level\". Mr Johnson has previously signalled his target covers reaching an agreement in principle, not signing a full deal. Experts say any agreement with India this year is likely to be a precursor to a full agreement, with talks still at a relatively early stage.  And Mr Johnson warned there would be \"tough asks\" from both sides. The meeting between the two leaders in India\'s capital came on the final day of Mr Johnson\'s two-day trip to the country, which has been delayed by Covid. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Johnson said India was \"an incredible rising power in Asia\" and deepening trade was a priority.  In a signal that he could be flexible over an Indian demand for looser immigration rules for its nationals as part of a deal, Mr Johnson said Indian skills could help sectors such as IT. \"I\'m not going to be dogmatic in refusing people with skill and talent in coming to the UK,\" he added. \"All I would say is we need to control it\". Britain is buying much more from India than it sells to India.  That\'s because India tends to put up high trade barriers such as taxes on UK exports, known as tariffs. Foreign cars attract tariffs of up to 100%, for example.  As a result, the UK currently sells less to India, with its vast population, than it does to Belgium. And it\'s getting worse: last year, the UK sold £4.7bn worth of goods to India and bought £8.4bn - that\'s the biggest gap between the UK and India\'s exports and imports that there\'s ever been.  If you include services, the gap is even bigger. The top five goods imported from India were clothing, medicine, fabrics, industrial machinery and electrical goods, with metals and power generators going in the other direction. Read more Ahead of the meeting, Downing Street announced the UK planned to streamline its licensing rules for exporting military hardware to India. No 10 said the UK would support India to construct fighter jets, in an attempt to reduce the volume of weapons bought from Russia. There was a commitment to increase research into lowering the cost of \"green\" hydrogen power - part of the UK\'s renewable energy plans. Mr Johnson also said he had raised the issue of India\'s relations with Russia during his meeting with Mr Modi. Along with other Western countries, the UK has been trying to persuade India to drop its neutral stance and join in condemning Moscow, which is its biggest arms supplier. Earlier this month, India condemned killings in the Ukrainian town of Bucha - the strongest statement it has made since Russia\'s invasion. But it stopped short of blaming Russia for the violence, and has not criticised Russia directly since its invasion in February. Mr Johnson said India had been \"very strong\" in its condemnation of the Bucha killings, and \"everybody understands and respects\" India\'s longstanding relationship with Russia. He said Mr Modi had \"intervened several times with Vladimir Putin to ask him what on earth he thinks he\'s doing\". \"What Indians want is peace, and the Russians out,\" he added.

The Financial Times reported that draft legislation could be published in May. The protocol is the Brexit deal that prevents a hard Irish border by keeping Northern Ireland inside the European Union\'s (EU) single market for goods. It creates a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. This is something the EU accepts is causing difficulties for many businesses. Boris Johnson was asked about the newspaper story during a visit to India on Friday. Mr Johnson said the UK would continue talking to the EU to seek reforms to the protocol but \"we don\'t rule out taking further steps if that is necessary\". \"This is something that has been a consistent issue for the UK government and I think it\'s very simple. \"It\'s about the balance of the Good Friday Agreement and because of what is happening, it would be fair to say, that the protocol really does not command the confidence of a large large component of the population in Northern Ireland. \"We have to address that, we have to fix that.\" Asked if that could include new legislation, he replied: \"Of course. That goes without saying.\" Article 16 of the protocol already gives the UK or the EU the right to introduce \"safeguard measures\" if the deal is causing serious difficulties which are liable to persist. But a new UK law would go much further than that, giving UK ministers broad discretion and reduced risk from legal challenge. The EU would be likely to view the move as a serious breach of the deal. The Financial Times suggested the law would, for example, give UK ministers the right to disregard the outcome of a Stormont consent vote on the protocol. Under the terms of the current deal the Stormont Assembly gets to vote every four years on whether the main provisions of the protocol should continue. Reacting to the story, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader, Doug Beattie, said he had \"no trust\" in what the UK government was doing and questioned the timing just two weeks before an election. \"If they\'re serious in this then they\'re going to have to put measures in place to make that sure we can deal with the issues that\'s going to come out at the other end of it. \"If they\'re going to bring forward a Northern Ireland act which deals with this issue then let\'s see it. Let politicians here in Northern Ireland see this and add value to it, as opposed to them just thinking:  \'This is what we should do because we think it\'s right\'.\" Sinn Féin\'s Conor Murphy said the UK government had been taking \"reckless actions\" by \"riding coach and horses through agreements they made in their own interests and not in the interests of the people here\". \"We cannot afford to spend another six or nine months that the British government are going to legislate, upend everything, that we understand in terms of the agreement that they\'ve come to with the European Union, and there needs to be international pressure applied to them.  \"Any action that the British government have taken have been about their own selfish interests, regardless of how reckless they have been. Regardless of how they\'ve broken through agreements, how they\'ve threatened to break international law, and we can\'t live in this type of uncertainty.\" Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader, Colum Eastwood said it was \"the same old story\" from the prime minister. \"He doesn\'t care about Northern Ireland, he cares about himself and his own position and that\'s what anyone engaging with him from the unionist side should understand by now. \"At some point this British government and the European Commission have to come to an agreement. That will not please the DUP because they want to rip everything up. The reality is the protocol is a massive opportunity for our businesses and our economy and we should be grasping it.\" DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the new law is \"just speculation\" at the minute but that he will believe the government when he actually sees such legislation put forward. \"The state opening of parliament and the Queen\'s speech will take place on 10 May and that will give us a clear indication as to whether the government indeed intends to include legislative proposals to remove the protocol,\" he said.  \"Clearly that\'s what we are pushing for and everyone knows our position that we are strongly opposed to the protocol.  \"This is harming every household in Northern Ireland, it is driving up the cost of prices in our supermarkets and impacting on the cost of living crisis.\" Stephen Farry, deputy leader of the Alliance Party, accused the prime minister of \"pandering to voices of extreme unionism in Northern Ireland\". \"We\'ve heard similar rumours before and once again we\'re seeing the threat of unilateral action on the protocol and any such action would be counter productive and self-defeating for the government,\" Mr Farry said.  \"The only way to resolve what are some genuine issues with the protocol are through negotiations between the UK and the European Union, because any changes have to be agreed mutually between the two parties under international law. \"We also have to give certainty and stability to businesses here, that they\'re operating in what is a secure and legal environment, otherwise it places everyone in jeopardy and undermines prospects of investment in Northern Ireland.\"  The protocol was agreed by the UK and the EU in October 2019. A series of so-called \"grace periods\" means it has never been fully implemented. Earlier this month the EU changed its laws to ensure Northern Ireland could continue to import medicines from the rest of the UK.

Even the Labour MP for neighbouring Stockton North, Alex Cunningham, was fooled into thinking one, and then another, of the accounts was genuine. At one point @JillWMortimerMP, @JillMortimerMP and @JillMortimer4HP were all claiming the others were fake. Mrs Mortimer\'s office has now confirmed she does not have a Twitter account. A spokesperson said she had not used the social media site since being elected and that the various impersonations had been reported to Parliamentary Services and Twitter. The tweets began on Thursday evening and quite quickly Mr Cunningham appealed for help in working out who was who. Earlier he had mocked one account for its small number of followers. At this point another account - @JillMortimer4HP - replied to Mr Cunningham to point out the first account was fake and that she was the real MP for Hartlepool, which he appeared to accept. The two phony accounts then carried on arguing between themselves, with each insisting the other was the imposter.  Mr Cunningham said it was a \"bit of fun\" and challenged the real Mrs Mortimer to \"visit Hartlepool and make herself known\". The confusion continued for about an hour with other Twitter users either joining in the quest for truth, enjoying the joke or, apparently, falling for one or other of the accounts\' assurances of legitimacy. The @JillWMortimer account, whose six followers include another of the fakes, then started the hashtag #WeAreJillMortimerMP. Much later in the evening, in an equally surreal thread, a Twitter user apparently living in the Wirral engaged with one of the fakes on the subjects of partygate, pineapples and sherry.

It would prevent the health service buying equipment worth billions from parts of China where it is claimed forced labour is used in supply chains. The government said it wanted to use the NHS\'s buying power to help \"eradicate modern slavery\". MPs are expected to hold a vote on the measure and pass it next week. Health Secretary Sajid Javid is due to introduce the new law as an amendment to the Health and Social Care Bill on Friday, after coming under cross-party pressure. The amendment says the health secretary must make regulations to \"eradicate\" the use of goods and services in the health service in England that are \"tainted\" by slavery and human trafficking. The change comes after Britain bought billions of pounds of protective health equipment during the Covid pandemic. some of which was allegedly manufactured by forced labour in China. The government revealed in February that the UK had bought £5.8bn worth of lateral flow tests from China. There have particularly been concerns about the use of forced labour in the Xinjiang province of western China. Reports have documented the detention of many thousands of people - mostly the largely Muslim Uyghur minority - in camps the authorities insist are for the re-education of extremists. Details of the new law have still to be worked out but the regulations are expected to set out the steps the NHS should take to assess the risks associated with individual suppliers and the basis on which they should be excluded from any tendering process.  Campaigners say this would effectively create a blacklist of companies banned from providing goods and services to the NHS - including medical equipment, security technology and basic infrastructure. A senior government source said the amendment would help ensure the NHS was not buying or using goods or services involving any kind of slave labour.  \"It\'s absolutely right that we use the NHS - a huge procurer of all sorts of goods and services - to help eradicate modern slavery around the world,\" the source said. Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran said: \"\"This is long overdue. It should not have taken a pandemic to shine a light on the hugely concerning links between supply chains involving forced labour - including those in Xinjiang - and PPE and other items used in our healthcare sector.\" She said the government should not stop here and should make a \"concerted effort\" to tackle modern slavery in all UK supply chains, as well as banning goods from Xinjiang altogether. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader, said it was a \"significant move\" that came after MPs had campaigned hard. He urged all other government departments to introduce the same regulations, saying: \"We will be sending the most powerful signal to those around the world that exploit and terrorise those weaker than themselves that the swords of justice are on their trail.\" Luke de Pulford, chief executive of anti-slavery campaign group Arise, which pushed for the change, said: \"This is easily the most significant advance in supply chain regulation since the Modern Slavery Act in 2015, and in many ways goes much further. \"I know all in the anti-slavery movement hope that the rest of government follows the health secretary\'s lead on this, and roots out slavery from our supply chains completely.\" Government ‘dragging feet’ on China forced labour Daily Mail donated masks linked to Uighur factory UK firms \'must wake up\' to China\'s cotton slaves', '1 day ago'),

He spoke to the BBC after France issued an international warrant for his arrest, citing allegedly suspect payments. Mr Ghosn said he was \"expecting\" the move though he was \"surprised at the timing\". Mr Ghosn faced charges of financial misconduct when he fled Japan in 2019. The former head of Nissan, once one of the most powerful figures in the car industry, is currently unable to leave Lebanon, as he is the subject of an Interpol Red Notice issued by Japan. He told the BBC: \"I want to stand trial because that\'s the only way I can get rid of the Red Notice which today forbids me from leaving Lebanon.\" He said he wanted a trial in Lebanon on the charges brought against him in Japan, and any that emerge from the French investigation -  and was \"totally confident\" he could prove his innocence. Prosecutors in France are investigating claims that Mr Ghosn funnelled millions of euros from Renault through Suhail Bahwan Automobiles. According to reports first published in the Wall Street Journal, he used the money for personal purchases including that of a 120-foot yacht. An investigating magistrate in France has now issued five international arrest warrants against Mr Ghosn and four people linked to a car distributor in Oman. Mr Ghosn told the BBC on Friday: \"There was not one euro [from Nissan or Renault] that ended up benefitting me directly or indirectly\". He denied he was a fugitive from justice - and repeated previous claims he had left Japan because he would not have had a fair trial there.  Mr Ghosn said the charges against him were part of a conspiracy to derail his plans for a full merger between Renault and Nissan. Since his escape, Carlos Ghosn has repeatedly claimed that the charges against him in Japan were baseless.  They were, he maintains, part of a conspiracy, designed to prevent him from orchestrating a merger between Nissan and its French partner Renault. But for several years a separate investigation has been quietly taking place in France. An investigating magistrate recently questioned Mr Ghosn at length in Beirut. The decision to issue an international arrest warrant suggests the French side believes there is a genuine case to answer at least. Mr Ghosn has said he would be happy to stand trial in France to clear his name, and his lawyers seem confident that would happen. But there\'s a problem. The former executive is banned from leaving Lebanon because he is still subject to an extradition request from Japan, even though that request is highly unlikely to be granted. For the moment, he remains in a legal limbo. Mr Ghosn once ran the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance, one of the biggest car-making groups in the world. He was arrested in Japan in late 2018, and faced a number of charges, including claims he deliberately mis-reported his earnings and used company money to fund his own lifestyle. He denied any wrongdoing. He has previously spoken of his dramatic escape from Japan, which involved disguising himself to go unnoticed through the streets of Tokyo, being hidden in a large music equipment box and fleeing to his native Lebanon as he awaited trial.  Mr Ghosn, who holds Brazilian, Lebanese and French passports, cannot be extradited to France from Beirut, although he confirmed to the BBC that he has been questioned as part of the investigation. He said he thought France had issued the arrest warrant because under its law the investigation could not be closed unless he was in French territory. \"So in a certain way we were expecting something like this to happen,\" he said. \"What was surprising was the timing...and also that we knew about it through an American newspaper...without me being officially alerted.\" Earlier, his lawyer, Jean Tamalet at King & Spalding, told the BBC: \"We believe this move is the only technical resort they found to be able in the future to try the case in a court of law.\" Warrants were also issued against the current owners and former directors of the car distributor, Suhail Bahwan Automobiles.

Tesco is allowing three items per customer. Waitrose and Morrisons have limited shoppers to two items each.  The majority of the UK\'s sunflower oil comes from Ukraine and disruption to exports has led to some shortages and an increased demand for alternatives.  The British Retail Consortium says the restrictions are a temporary measure \"to ensure availability for everyone.\"  Olive, rapeseed and sunflower oils are included in the limits being put in place by some supermarkets, both in-store and online. Iceland have not yet commented on pictures posted on social media of signs that have appeared in its stores limiting sales of two-litre and five-litre bottles of sunflower oil to one per customer.  Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Waitrose said: \"We are closely monitoring the situation and working with our suppliers to ensure customers continue to have a choice of cooking oils.\" Grocery expert Ged Futter says shoppers can be reassured that there are plenty of alternatives when it comes to cooking oils. \"We are used to an abundance of varieties, what we may see is that they become more limited,\" he says. But he also warned that sunflower oil may soon be unavailable on the shelves. \"These limits may delay things a bit, but in a couple of months, there won\'t be any sunflower oil available to buy,\" he suggests. Sainsbury\'s and Asda are not currently limiting how much cooking oil their customers can buy. A spokesperson for Sainsbury\'s said: \"We are working closely with our suppliers to make sure customers continue to have cooking oils to choose from including olive oil, vegetable oil and rapeseed oil.\" Tom Holder from the British Retail Consortium said that the restrictions being put in place by some supermarkets are a temporary measure, \"to ensure availability for everyone.\"  He added that \"retailers are working with suppliers to ramp up production of alternative cooking oils, to minimise the impact on consumers.\" Analysis by retail research firm Assosia also suggests that the reduced supply of sunflower oil as a result of the conflict in Ukraine is having an impact on prices. It has tracked changes in the average cost of sunflower oil across major retailers including Tesco, Sainsbury\'s, Asda, Morrisons, Aldi and Lidl. Its data suggests that a one-litre bottle of own-brand sunflower oil has gone up by an average of 12p to £1.26 since January 2022 - an increase of more than 10%.  For a five-litre bottle, the increase was 38p or 6%. There had been no change in the average price of a one-litre of own-brand organic sunflower oil, which stood at £3.10.  UK food manufacturers that use sunflower oil as an ingredient in their products, such as crisps and oven chips, have also reported concerns over supplies.  The Food Standards Agency and Food Standards Scotland have told consumers that some products labelled as containing sunflower oil may in fact contain alternatives such as rapeseed oil, in a move to try and make sure products remain available. They cautioned that anyone with allergies should look out for extra information. UK sunflower oil bottler has few weeks\' supply left Five ways the Ukraine war could push up prices', '6 hours ago');

Alan Barratt, 62, and Susan Dalton, 66, tricked people into transferring savings to schemes supposedly investing in property or \"truffle trees\". One victim told the BBC that the fraudsters had wanted to secure their own pension \"by taking mine instead\". Barratt and Dalton admitted fraud based on their roles as pension trustees. More than £13m of pension savings were transferred, and the pair forwarded most of the money to the mastermind of the criminal enterprise, David Austin, from Guildford in Surrey. A previous case heard evidence that he used it to live a life of luxury including ski holidays and trips to Dubai. It was funnelled offshore and funded his businesses, was used to pay others involved in the operation, and enriched himself and family members. He killed himself in 2019, before the criminal investigation was completed.  At Southwark Crown Court on Friday, Barratt was jailed for five years and seven months while Dalton was jailed for four years and eight months. Both stood and looked straight ahead in the dock as the sentences were handed down.  Passing sentence, Judge Gregory Perrins said the pair caused \"such misery to so many people\", with victims suffering mental health problems and some even attempting suicide. \"Each account that I have read is a story of a life ruined by your actions and you should both be ashamed,\" he said. Former mineworker Stephen O\'Reilly was among their victims, lost more than £100,000, and now has to work in a bookmakers to pay his bills. \"My pension has gone. I am going to have to work for the rest of my life,\" the 62-year-old said. He answered an advert for a free pension review 10 years ago, in the hope he could release some funds to renovate and sell homes in Spain. \"My kids are grown up but I wanted to make some money to leave to them,\" he told the BBC. The supposed review led to a call from Dalton after which he transferred £114,000 in pension savings. He was given a small commission, which was actually part of his own pension, and told some of the money would be invested in overseas property. He expected to receive a lump sum at the age of 55, and had even ordered a new car in anticipation. The money never arrived and when he enquired, he discovered he had been the victim of a scam. Previously, his mineworker\'s pension from 14 years working underground had been inappropriately transferred and he received compensation. This time, the money had disappeared entirely. \"It is a lesson learnt, and now I can only hope some other people will learn from my lesson,\" he said. Pauline Padden had received a text about a pension review when she was 50, and eventually transferred £45,000 - thinking she was investing in property in holiday resorts in the Caribbean. She became suspicious when she did not receive any paperwork, and was then notified that she had been the victim of a scam. \"If that money had been properly invested, it would have meant I could retire when I wanted to retire,\" said Mrs Padden, 58, who has been a critical care nurse for 40 years. \"Now that has been completely taken from me. It has gone forever. I\'m not sure I will ever see that money again - I doubt it.\" She said the experience had left her anxious and she finds it hard to trust people. Her family are worried about her. \"I felt stupid. I felt duped. That is not a nice feeling to have,\" she said, urging others to be wary of similar offers. While she faces many more years working in the stressful surroundings of the NHS, she describes those behind the scam as \"greedy\" and hopes their conviction will be a deterrent to others. \"They are not much different in age than me. They were looking for their own pension pot, and decided to take mine instead - and that of many people as well as me,\" she said. \"I was just trying to secure a future so I wouldn\'t have to depend on the state, but they have just happily and willingly stolen that money off me. They knew when they were taking it. They knew, and they just took it anyway.\" Barratt, Dalton, and Austin were among those who ran 10 dishonest pension schemes. In 2018, Austin and Barratt were ordered to repay £7.7m and Austin and Dalton £5.9m to those who had lost out. However, none of the victims have yet to receive a penny of the money they should have been refunded. The High Court ruling, reported by the BBC at the time, was a legal first as it came after an application from The Pensions Regulator, which had been granted new powers. One victim in that case said he and his wife were assured their pensions would be invested in low-risk investments. They were then sent details of a firm producing so-called truffle trees in the West Country. Criminal investigations followed the civil proceedings, which culminated in Friday\'s sentencing. Barratt, of Burnham Road, Althorne, Essex, and Dalton, 66, of Brookdale, Rochdale, Lancashire, both admitted charges of fraud by abuse of position in breach of the Fraud Act 2006 arising from their roles as trustees of pension schemes. In addition to their jail terms, both have been banned from being directors of companies for eight years. A confiscation hearing, to recover what might remain of the profits of the scam, is set to take place in November. On Friday, Southwark Crown Court heard that Barratt, an \"unsophisticated\" former photocopier salesman, trusted Austin and did not want to \"rock the boat\" because he was paid more than he had ever been paid before. Initially, he believed what he was doing was lawful, the court heard.     In mitigation for Dalton, the court heard that she \"turned a blind eye\" to the fraud. In a statement read in court, she said she apologised to victims and punished herself every single day for her part in the fraud.  Pensions minister Guy Opperman said he welcomed the sentence and thanked the Pensions Regulator \"for its role in bringing the perpetrators to justice\". Lead lawyer for the regulator, Carl Dowling, branded the scam \"despicable\", adding the sentence sent \"a clear message\". \"Pension scams ruin lives.

Online sales fell sharply as people cut down on non-essential spending, the Office for National Statistics said. Fuel sales also dropped as people cut travel amid record petrol and diesel prices. However, overall retail sales were still above pre-Covid levels, the ONS said. Retail sales fell by an unexpected 1.4% in the month, and February\'s sales figures were also revised down. Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics, said \"Online sales were hit particularly hard due to lower levels of discretionary spending. \"Fuel sales also fell substantially, with evidence suggesting some people reduced non-essential journeys, following record high petrol prices, while food sales continued to fall, dropping for the fifth consecutive month.\" The cost of living crisis is being driven by surges in fuel, energy and food prices, with inflation running at 7% - its highest rate for 30 years. Energy and fuel prices had been rising even before Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine as economies started to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, and the conflict has pushed up prices further. Bethany Beckett, UK economist for Capital Economics, said inflation was set to keep rising and \"there\'s a real risk of an outright fall in consumer spending in the coming quarters\". The biggest contribution to the March retail sales slide came from the drop in online sales, which have been falling from pandemic highs after coronavirus restrictions eased. \"The sharp decline in sales in March suggests that households are already paring back spending to cope with higher costs for food and fuel,\" said Ms Beckett. \"That is only likely to worsen in the coming months as the cost of living crisis intensifies. After all, the March data predated April\'s huge 54% rise in utility bills which will have hit household budgets hard.\" Separately, a survey by GfK suggested that UK consumer confidence in April dropped to its second-lowest level in 50 years due to people\'s weakening confidence in the economy and in their personal finances. Consumer confidence was at its lowest ebb since July 2008, which was during the severe worldwide economic crisis, the market research firm said. by Ramzan Karmali, BBC business correspondent The bigger-than-expected fall in retail sales last month was largely down to the current cost of living crisis - that\'s according to ONS officials.  Online sales of non-essential items fell again, and the data suggests that record high petrol prices are having a major impact with a cut in non-essential journeys. More significantly perhaps is the fact food sales have been falling since last November, which is a sign that consumers are paring back their spending to cope with higher costs. Economists believe the situation will only become more acute as March\'s data came before April\'s 54% hike in gas and electricity bills. They also point to falling consumer confidence - the survey for this in April slumped to its lowest level in 14 years. Meanwhile, a survey of businesses suggested a slowdown in private sector growth in April. The UK\'s dominant services sector saw growth slow sharply, the S&P Global/CIPS composite Purchasing Managers\' Index indicated. Although manufacturing growth picked up slightly after a five-month low in March, new manufacturing orders from abroad fell by the most since June 2020 as orders from Europe fell back. Firms also said export orders were hit by Brexit, recent congestion in UK ports and sanctions on Russia, the survey found. There was also a sharp rise in company insolvencies in March, according to official data. The number of firms going bust rose to 2,114 in March, more than double the number in March 2021, and a third higher than pre-pandemic figures. The Bank of England has been raising interest rates to try to cool inflation, and its key rate currently stands at 0.75%. Its governor, Andrew Bailey, said on Thursday that the Bank was walking a tight line between dealing with inflation and avoiding recession. Bank of England monetary policymaker Catherine Mann said that interest rates would probably have to go up \"a little bit\" further. Asked about the risk of so-called \"stagflation\", which is a combination of slow growth and high inflation, Ms Mann said \"in some senses, we could say we\'re already there\" because of the jump in energy prices and slowing retail sales. \"But I think that, you know, it\'s premature to kind of hearken back to the 1980s or the 1970s, in the US context in particular, and use that vocabulary,\" she said.

He was addressing an International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank conference via video link from Kyiv. The World Bank has estimated that about $60bn of physical damage has so far been inflicted on Ukraine. Mr Zelensky also said the global community needed to exclude Russia immediately from international financial institutions, including the World Bank, IMF and others. All countries \"must immediately be prepared to break up all relations with Russia,\" he added. Asked whether the IMF would be able to secure the immediate funding that Ukraine needs, the organisation\'s managing director Kristalina Georgieva told BBC economics editor Faisal Islam: \"We found it for the first and second month. \"We believe that over time this amount is going to go down as the Ukrainian economy in the parts of the country that are not under occupation picks up, and as remittances from those who now work somewhere else start flowing.\" Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Russia should be made to pay some of the cost of rebuilding Ukraine after the war.  It came as some nations have called for seized Russian assets to be used to fund the country\'s reconstruction. However, Ms Yellen cautioned that using seized Russian central bank reserves in the US to rebuild Ukraine would be a \"significant step\" that would need discussions and agreement with international partners. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, who attended the conference in person, said the country\'s economic output could decline by as much as 50%, with direct and indirect losses so far totalling $560bn.  That figure is more than three times the size of Ukraine\'s gross domestic product (GDP), which stood at $155.5bn in 2020, according to the World Bank. \"If we do not stop this war together, the losses will increase dramatically,\" Mr Shmyhal said, adding that Ukraine would need a reconstruction programme similar to the post-World War Two Marshall Plan that helped to rebuild Europe. World Bank President David Malpass, meanwhile, said the damage to Ukraine\'s buildings and infrastructure from Russia\'s invasion had reached around $60bn and warned that the figure will rise further as the war continues. Mr Malpass said the early estimate of \"narrow\" damage costs does not include the growing economic impact on Ukraine. Also on Thursday, the US imposed further sanctions on Russian ships, while the UK targeted luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds with import bans and higher tariffs.

Adam Scorer, boss of fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, called for action before it was too late. The Resolution think tank, said one solution could be a social tariff, with wealthier customers paying more to fund discounted rates for those struggling. Big energy firms have warned hundreds of thousands may struggle to pay bills. At least 40% of energy giant E.ON\'s customers will go into fuel poverty as prices rise this year, the company\'s chief executive told the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee on Tuesday, while the head of Scottish Power said this autumn would be \"horrific\" for poor customers. The price cap is set to be increased again in October, potentially pushing an average annual bill up to £2,600, one analyst has told the BBC. To date, the government has said it will offer extra relief of £150 in April via the council tax system in England, and in October customers in England, Scotland and Wales will receive a £200 rebate on their energy bills. They will have to repay this at £40 a year for five years, starting in April 2023. The warm house discount scheme is also being expanded to cover three million households. It offers low income households a one-off annual discount on their electricity bill, and was worth £140 in 2021-22. \"The scale of this problem is beyond what the energy companies can do. This is a catastrophe for many households on the lowest income. \"It means the government has another chance to get ahead of the next phase of this crisis. It has spurned the ones it has had before,\" Adam Scorer, chief executive of National Energy Action, told Radio 4\'s Today Programme. Torsten Bell, whose think tank Resolution Foundation focuses on those on lower incomes, said energy bosses were right to focus people on \"the catastrophe coming this autumn\".  \"They\'re right to say we aren\'t doing enough,\" he added. Mr Bell said a social tariff was \"definitely worth exploring\", in part because it would target money at those on the lowest incomes. Until 2011, energy companies offered cheaper packages to customers that were in fuel poverty, meaning that 10% or more of their income was spent on gas and electricity. They also offered the tariffs, which often matched the cheapest deal available on the market, to customers over 60 years old, on means-tested benefits, or on a low income.  But Mr Bell cautioned that social tariffs also presented their own problems.  He pointed to the low take up of similar packages for broadband internet, which have so far only been adopted by 1-2% of Universal Credit claimants, while adding that raising bills even further for middle and top earners was \"unlikely to be a good idea\" in the short term. \"And in the longer term, the government is already looking at using energy bills to pay for some of the energy infrastructure that we need. \"The big challenge with this as an approach is do we really want to use energy bills to pay for help for poorer households,\" he added.

Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) says it will issue refunds to subscribers after the service is shut down on 30 April. The head of CNN+ has resigned and hundreds more workers could be at risk of losing their jobs. This week, $50bn (£38.4bn) was wiped off the stock market value of streaming giant Netflix after it revealed a sharp fall in subscribers. CNN+ was launched on 29 March in an attempt to bring in revenues from news streaming subscriptions. The company spent as much as $300m on developing the service but it got off to a slow start, attracting just 10,000 viewers a day, according to reports. Earlier this month, WBD became CNN\'s parent company with the completion of the merger of media company Discovery and telecom giant AT&T.  Chris Licht, incoming chief executive of CNN, said the business \"will be strongest as part of WBD\'s streaming strategy which envisions news as an important part of a compelling broader offering along with sports, entertainment, and nonfiction content\". \"We have therefore made the decision to cease operations of CNN+,\" Mr Licht said in a statement. Discovery\'s streaming boss JB Perrette said the firm was searching for a \"more sustainable business model to drive our future investments in great journalism and storytelling\". As part of the shakeup, Andrew Morse, who helped to drive CNN\'s streaming strategy, will leave the company. Hundreds of CNN+ employees have also been given 90 days to secure a job in other parts of the company, CNN reported. Those who fail to do so will receive a severance package of at least six months pay, it said.  It comes after streaming giant Netflix reported a plunge in subscribers in the first three months of the year.  On Tuesday, Netflix said the number of households using its streaming service fell by 200,000 as it faced stiff competition from rivals. The platform also warned shareholders another two million subscribers were likely to leave in the three months to July.

Equity, the performing arts workers union, has launched a new campaign, \"Stop AI Stealing the Show\". AI can use samples of an actor\'s voice or face, to generate content including so-called \"deep fakes\". \"From automated audiobooks to digital avatars, AI systems are now replacing skilled professional performers\" the union says. It warns of \"dystopian\" consequences unless copyright law adapts. Equity highlights a number of different ways actors\' voices and likenesses may be used. For example actors may work with AI firms to create systems that can generate artificial voice-overs or to help them create digital \"avatars\". And \"synthetic\" performances can be created using AI, in some cases even allowing deceased actors to appear in films.  While AI-generated performances can be a useful creative tool, the union is concerned that actors may not always be able to control the use of their likeness, or their likeness may be used without consent or adequate remuneration. AI generated \"deep fake\" videos of celebrities have become increasingly popular online. Actor Talulah Riley who supports the campaign told the union \"As a performer, it is vital that my voice and my image are my own, no matter how easily and cheaply those things can be digitally replicated. I believe that performers must be rewarded fairly for the content we create.\" Where actors work with AI companies, most do not know their rights, and many are required to sign non-disclosure agreements the union says. In a survey of 430 of its members the union found that 93% of audio artists felt that AI posed a threat to their employment opportunities. One respondent to the survey told the union: \"In the last six months, my voice has been used in huge marketing campaigns by global companies. I don\'t receive a penny, even though I believe my contract does not allow for third party advertising.\" Equity said: \"AI\'s increasing capacity to clone human voices presents a substantial risk that the voice owner will either be under-compensated or not paid at all . Equity says it is particularly concerned about the development of digital voice technology for automated audiobook creation. The campaign is backed by Bev Standing who sued TikTok over the use of her voice. The Canadian voiceover artist recorded about 10,000 sentences of audio for the state-backed Chinese Institute of Acoustics research body to use in translations, in 2018. But her voice, Ms Standing alleged, was later used by TikTok in a feature which converted writing into speech, which could then be played over videos uploaded to the app, often for comedic effect. This included, Ms Standing claimed, videos where the synthetic voice repeated profanities. TikTok settled the lawsuit.  Ms Standing told equity \"I now only work with companies where I have control over where my voice gets licensed\". The union argues existing copyright law does not give performers sufficient protection, because AI \"reproduces performances without generating a recording or a copy\". Equity wants the government to take action to protect performers\' rights and wants reform of copyright laws to \"keep pace with technological development\". However there may be concerns that changes to copyright law could have a negative impact on free speech or stifle innovation. The government told the BBC it wanted to ensure AI was regulated in a way that encouraged innovation \"while protecting people and our fundamental values\". \"Our national AI strategy has a ten-year vision for seizing the opportunities of the technology and we will set out our approach to its governance in due course\" a government statement said.

The arrangement will supplement the contract the London-headquartered firm has with American rival and rocket operator SpaceX of California. The new deal was announced as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnston headed to India for two days of talks. The firm was forced to look for alternatives when its deal with the Russian space agency fell apart. OneWeb said the first Indian launch of its broadband internet satellites could take place by the year\'s end. The spacecraft would go up from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre on Sriharikota Island in the east of the country. The rocket to be used is likely to be India\'s Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), its largest and most capable vehicle. Some sort of deal with NewSpace India, the commercial arm of the country\'s national space agency, was expected. OneWeb\'s largest shareholder is the Indian conglomerate Bharti Global. Its chairman, Sunil Bharti Mittal, is also the executive chairman at OneWeb.  \"This is yet another historic day for collaboration in space, thanks to the shared ambition and vision of NewSpace India and OneWeb,\" he said in a statement. \"This most recent agreement on launch plans adds considerable momentum to the development of OneWeb\'s network, as we work together across the space industry toward our common goal of connecting communities globally.\" OneWeb\'s plans to build a global network of internet satellites in the sky was knocked off course in March by the war in Ukraine. The conflict, and the resulting western sanctions against Russia, led to the company losing access to Russian Soyuz rockets. With only two-thirds of the satellites in orbit needed to complete its network, OneWeb had little choice but to go to SpaceX to book some rides on the California outfit\'s Falcon rockets. SpaceX is currently building its own space-borne internet service called Starlink. OneWeb didn\'t say how many Indian launches it would use, or what its contract with NewSpace India was worth.  The GSLV can lift about nine tonnes to low-Earth orbit - similar to the Soyuz. It was last used in 2019 to launch India\'s Chandrayaan-2 Moon mission. OneWeb has so far launched 428 satellites, enough to provide internet broadband connections above 50 degrees North in latitude. It needs, however, to get to 650 or so to start delivering connections across the whole Earth. The company\'s intention is to expand later generations of the network to encompass 7,000 satellites in orbit, meaning the GSLV could become a key component in the future of the OneWeb project. \"We welcome the partnership between OneWeb and NewSpace India Limited (NSIL); it\'s a historic development and this will surely pave the way for a greater participation of private space players, resulting in a boost to the Indian space economy,\" said Lt. Gen. Anil Kumar Bhatt (Retd), the director general of the Indian Space Association. \"This partnership has the potential to drive the attention of many international players towards India\'s capabilities, leading to a significant increase in our share in the international space economy which is just 2.6% currently; and at the same time contribute to nation building and economic growth of the country,\" he told BBC News.    Building space-borne internet systems is the vogue of the moment. As well as OneWeb and SpaceX-Starlink, the Amazon online retailer is about to get into this market.

The number of households using the streaming service fell by 200,000 in the first three months of the year as it faced stiff competition from rivals.  It was also hit after it raised prices in some countries and left Russia. Netflix warned shareholders another two million subscribers were likely to leave in the three months to July. \"Our revenue growth has slowed considerably,\" the firm told shareholders on Tuesday after publishing its first quarter results. \"Our relatively high household penetration - when including the large number of households sharing accounts - combined with competition, is creating revenue growth headwinds.\" The streaming giant estimates more than 100 million households watch the service for free using shared passwords.  Boss Reed Hastings previously described the practice as \"something you have to learn to live with\", adding that much of it is \"legitimate\" between family members. The firm also said account sharing had probably fuelled its growth by getting more people using Netflix.  But on Tuesday, Mr Hastings said it was making it hard to attract new subscribers in some countries. \"When we were growing fast, it wasn\'t a high priority to work on [account sharing]. And now we\'re working super hard on it,\" he told shareholders.  The firm said payment plans it is testing to curb password sharing in Latin America could be rolled out to other countries. Since last month, account holders in Chile, Costa Rica and Peru must pay to add user profiles for people outside their household (the company currently allows people who live together to share their Netflix account).  Users can add up to two extra profiles for $2-$3 (£1.53-£2.30) a month each, on top of their regular fee.  Netflix - which did not say how it would enforce the rule - said it was seeking a \"customer centric\" solution. \"The principle way we have is asking our members to pay a bit more to share the service outside their homes,\" said Greg Peters, Netflix\'s chief product officer. Dominic Sunnebo, an analyst at research firm Kantar, warned the plan could backfire at a time when consumers were looking for ways to save money. \"If the schemes to counter password sharing move too fast and too aggressively, it also risks alienating a potential future audience - many who password-share beyond the household are not actually aware they\'re breaking the terms of their subscription.\"  Netflix said that pulling out of Russia in March in response to the Ukraine war had cost it 700,000 subscribers.  And another 600,000 people stopped using its service in the US and Canada after it put up prices in January. The firm raised prices across all of its US plans, with a basic plan increasing from $9 to $10 per month, and a standard from $14 to $15.50. In the UK, basic and standard plans have both increased by £1 a month to £6.99 and £10.99 respectively. Netflix said the price rises would yield more money for the firm, despite the cancellations. But analysts say the rising cost of streaming services is wearing on households as the cost of living rises.  In the UK, households cancelled more than 1.5 million streaming subscriptions in the first three months of the year, with 38% saying they wanted to save money.  Seeming to acknowledge this, Mr Hastings said Netflix was looking at launching a free ad-supported service like its rivals Disney and HBO.  Analysts say it could open a significant new revenue stream for the company, which has so far shunned advertising. \"Those who have followed Netflix know that I\'ve been against the complexity of advertising, and a big fan of the simplicity of subscription,\" he said. \"But, as much as I\'m a fan of that, I\'m a bigger fan of consumer choice.\" Netflix\'s biggest threat is intense competition from firms such as Amazon, Apple and Disney, which are pouring money into their online streaming services, according to experts. Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight, said Netflix\'s subscriber loss was a \"reality check\", as it tries to balance retaining subscribers with raising its revenue. Tell us how you have been affected by the issues raised in this story. \"While Netflix and other services were key in lockdown, users are now thinking twice about their purchasing behaviour based upon changing habits,\" he said. North America especially is \"now awash with too many services chasing too few dollars\", he added.  Shares in the streaming giant plunged in early trade in New York on Wednesday, dropping more than 30% off the back of the update. The firm - which remains the world\'s leading streaming service with more than 220 million subscribers - had enjoyed uninterrupted quarterly growth in subscribers since October 2011.  However, it said a surge in sign-ups during the pandemic had \"obscured\" the real picture around its growth.

Speaking at the Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, Ms Harris said it was part of the Biden administration\'s strategy to promote responsible use of space. She said stopping the direct ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) missile testing will safeguard satellites in low-Earth orbit - and she urged other nations to follow suit. \"This debris presents a risk to the safety of our astronauts, our satellites and our growing commercial presence,\" she said.  \"A piece of space debris the size of a basketball, which travels at thousands of miles per hour, would destroy a satellite. Even a piece of debris as small as a grain of sand could cause serious damage.\" In November last year, Russia test-launched an anti-satellite missile that struck a defunct Soviet-era spy satellite in low-Earth orbit, creating at least 1,632 pieces of space debris, according to a US Space Force database of orbital objects. The debris posed risks to active satellites in orbit. US astronauts aboard the International Space Station were forced to seek shelter in their docked capsule, which disrupted their work. If the debris collides with functioning satellites, vital services like GPS and weather warnings could be in jeopardy. China conducted a similar test in 2007. Vice-President Harris said: \"Today, we are taking a major step forward in this effort, a step that specifically addresses the problem of destructive missile tests in space, like the one Russia took in November.  \"That, of course, is when Russia launched a missile to destroy a satellite in space. \"These tests are part of their efforts to develop anti-satellite weapons systems. These weapons are intended to deny the United States our ability to use our space capabilities by disrupting, destroying our satellites - satellites which are critical to our national security.\" Overall, these tests jeopardise the long-term sustainability of outer space and imperil the exploration and use of space by all nations, she added. The announcement comes amid increased US intelligence co-operation with Ukraine, as Russia\'s invasion drags on. The US first indicated its support for an anti-satellite weapon test ban in December.

Scientists examined the impact of 1,500 protected areas in 68 countries, focusing their analysis on wetlands and waterbirds.  They found that, in terms of how wildlife fared, success varied hugely around the world and depended a great deal on how an area was managed.  The study was published in Nature. Its authors say that habitats need to be managed effectively in ways that provide a boost for nature.  \"There need to be rules in place and restoration,\" said lead researcher Dr Hannah Wauchope, from the Centre for Ecology and Conservation at University of Exeter.  \"We can\'t just draw a line around an area and say, \'you can\'t build a car park here\'.\" Dr Wauchope explained that the study used population trends of wetland birds as a measure of the success of a protected area, which can be anything from an area of outstanding natural beauty to a carefully managed nature reserve. She and her colleagues also compared sites before and after they were officially protected, and compared the trends of similar bird populations inside and outside protected areas.  \"In the majority of places we looked, wildlife populations were still stable or were increasing, but they weren\'t doing any better than in unprotected areas,\" she told BBC News.   \"That\'s disappointing, but not surprising.

The combined pressures of global heating and farming are driving a \"substantial decline\" of insects across the globe, according to UK researchers. They say we must acknowledge the threats we pose to insects, before some species are lost forever. But preserving habitat for nature could help ensure vital insects thrive. Lead researcher, Dr Charlie Outhwaite of UCL, said losing insect populations could be harmful not only to the natural environment, but to \"human health and food security, particularly with losses of pollinators\".  \"Our findings highlight the urgency of actions to preserve natural habitats, slow the expansion of high-intensity agriculture, and cut emissions to mitigate climate change,\" she added. Plummeting populations of insects around the world - a so-called \"insect apocalypse\" - have caused widespread concern. However, scientific data gives a mixed picture, with some types of insects showing drastic declines, while others are staying steady.  In the latest study, the researchers pulled together data on the range and number of nearly 20,000 insect species, including bees, ants, butterflies, grasshoppers and dragonflies, at about 6,000 different locations. In areas with high-intensity agriculture and substantial warming, insect numbers have plunged by 49% and the number of different species by 27%, compared with relatively untouched places that have so far avoided the most severe impacts of climate change, according to the research, published in Nature. But the researchers said there was some cause for hope in that setting aside areas of land for nature created a refuge for insects, which need shade to survive in hot weather. \"Careful management of agricultural areas, such as preserving natural habitats near farmland, may help to ensure that vital insects can still thrive,\" said Dr Tim Newbold, also of UCL.

Cambridge University researchers analysed more than 2,000 skeletons and found elites ate no more meat than other social groups. One study also suggested peasants occasionally hosted lavish meat feasts for their rulers.  Researchers said the findings overturned major assumptions about early medieval English history. Cambridge University bioarchaeologist Sam Leggett drew her conclusions after analysing chemical signatures of diets preserved in the bones of 2,023 people buried in England from the 5th to 11th Centuries.  She then cross-referenced these with evidence for social status such as grave goods, body position and grave orientation and found no correlation between social status and high protein diets. The findings surprised Cambridge University historian Tom Lambert, because so many medieval texts and historical studies suggested that Anglo-Saxon elites did eat large quantities of meat. The pair worked together to decipher royal food lists and discovered similar patterns of servings - like a modest amount of bread, a huge amount of meat, a decent but not excessive quantity of ale, and no mention of vegetables, although some probably were served. Mr Lambert said: \"The scale and proportions of these food lists strongly suggests that they were provisions for occasional grand feasts, and not general food supplies sustaining royal households on a daily basis.\" Dr Leggett said: \"I\'ve found no evidence of people eating anything like this much animal protein on a regular basis.  \"If they were, we would find isotopic evidence of excess protein and signs of diseases like gout from the bones. But we\'re just not finding that.   \"The isotopic evidence suggests that diets in this period were much more similar across social groups than we\'ve been led to believe.  \"We should imagine a wide range of people livening up bread with small quantities of meat and cheese, or eating pottages of leeks and whole grains with a little meat thrown in.\"  The researchers believe that even royals would have eaten a cereal-based diet and that these occasional feasts - examples of which have been excavated in East Anglia - would have been a treat for them too.   \"Historians generally assume that medieval feasts were exclusively for elites,\" said Mr Lambert. \"But these food lists show that even if you allow for huge appetites, 300 or more people must have attended.  \"That means that a lot of ordinary farmers must have been there, and this has big political implications.\"  He added: \"We\'re looking at kings travelling to massive barbecues hosted by free peasants, people who owned their own farms and sometimes slaves to work on them.  \"You could compare it to a modern presidential campaign dinner in the US.

(262, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-61155725', 7, 'bbc', 'Make Uranus mission your priority, Nasa told', 'Jonathan AmosScience correspondent@BBCAmoson Twitter The US space agency Nasa should prioritise a mission to Uranus, an influential panel of scientists says. The \"ice giant\" is the seventh planet in our Solar System, orbiting the Sun 19 times further out than the Earth. It\'s only ever been visited once before, in a brief flyby by the Voyager-2 probe in 1986. Researchers think an in-depth study of Uranus can help them better understand the many similarly sized objects now being discovered around other stars. The recommendation is made in a document published by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS). Known as a \"decadal survey\", it is the summation of what the American research community thinks are the big planetary science questions right now and the space missions required to answer them. Nasa has broadly followed the recommendations of previous National Academies reports. The last planetary decadal survey, published in 2011, had as its two top priorities a rock-collection mission to Mars, which became the Perseverance rover, now on the surface of the Red Planet; and a mission to Jupiter and its moon Europa, which is currently being prepared for launch in 2024. This is called the Europa Clipper spacecraft. Specialists who study the outer planets in our Solar System have been campaigning for a return visit to either Uranus or Neptune ever since their late-80s Voyager-2 encounters. And the science case has only strengthened over the intervening years, proponents argue. Look at the size-range of planets now being discovered around other stars and they seem to dominate in a range that\'s about three and four times the width of the Earth. That\'s Uranus and Neptune.  \"And that actually poses a problem for planet formation theories,\" explained Prof Leigh Fletcher, who contributed to the report. \"We think we understand how something gets as big as Jupiter, and we think we understand how something gets to be the size of Earth and Venus. But in the middle, in that kind of sweet spot between those end-members - we don\'t fully understand how a world can start to grow and grow and not just carry on to become Jupiter-mass in size. A mission to Uranus could help us answer that,\" the Leicester University, UK, scientist told BBC News. There are favourable launch opportunities in 2031 and 2032 that would allow a spacecraft to use a gravity slingshot around Jupiter to shorten the cruise time to Uranus to \"just\" 13 years.  The spacecraft would go into orbit around the planet, which would preclude any observations at the more-distant Neptune. The eighth and outermost planet will have to wait its turn. Uranus is an oddity compared with the other planets in the Solar System in that its axis of rotation is almost parallel with the plane of its orbit around the Sun. It\'s as if it has been knocked on to its side, which may well be the explanation - scientists speculate that it suffered a massive impact with another body early in its history. Uranus has rings and plenty of moons.  Indeed, the moons are quite a draw because a good many of them are likely to be \"ocean worlds\". \"This is the idea that you\'ve got an icy crust and then you\'ve got some kind of liquid briny ocean down at depth that may or may not be in contact with whatever silicate rocky material is down at the bottom,\" said Prof Fletcher. \"Well, all of the big five classical satellites of Uranus are thought of as being ocean world candidates. These moons could have cryo-volcanic (ice volcano) activity taking place on them.\" Dr Robin Canup from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, was the co-chair on the Academies\' steering committee. She said an ice giant was a worthy target for a Nasa flagship and of all the potential candidates assessed in what would be the most expensive class of endeavour, the Uranus mission was the most mature technically. \"It was the only one to receive a low-medium rating for its risk,\" she explained.  \"So because of that, we are extremely excited to recommend that the highest priority new flagship should be a Uranus orbiter and probe. This will be a fantastic multi-year mission with the probe dropping into the planet at the beginning of the mission, followed by an extended orbital tour investigating the satellites, their interiors, the magnetosphere, the rings, and the atmosphere.  \"It is technically ready to start now. We recommend that it be initiated in financial year 2024.\"  European-based planetary researchers, like Prof Fletcher, will be hoping the European Space Agency (Esa) can contribute to such a mission. Nasa and Esa are frequent partners, such as on the Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn (2004-2017), but their priorities and funding cycles do not always coincide.  And for Nasa, the speed at which it\'s able to implement the recommendation will depend on its other financial commitments.  The decadal survey panel said completing the Perseverance rover\'s objectives and the follow-up missions designed to bring its rock samples back to Earth came before everything else in importance.', '@BBCAmoson Twitter'),

Readers outside the US may not share the American enthusiasm for competitive hotdog swallowing. But maybe they can relate to the feeling. We\'ve all spent the last few years, the last two especially, binge-watching, indiscriminately, too mesmerised to click the off-button. Are we maybe just a little bit sick of it? That\'s the fear seizing executives in Netflix\'s boardroom right now. That Mr Weiner, a 28-year-old artist from Denver, Colorado, who loved the streaming service at first, especially for watching old favourites like Star Trek and The Office, typifies a new mood. That after years of skyrocketing subscriber growth, people will switch off, not just their television sets, but their direct debits too. Mr Weiner is one of the hundreds of thousands who have already cancelled, prompting a moment of high drama for the company this week as its share price plummeted and confidence in its future wobbled.  People have begun to ask whether Netflix\'s star, as the world\'s largest streaming service, is beginning to fade. \"Netflix lost some of my favourite shows,\" says Mr Weiner. \"And I never know which show will disappear next.\" He thinks there\'s more clickbait than there was - enticing teaser clips that don\'t live up to expectations - and some poor writing. \"There are better streaming deals than Netflix right now,\" he says. Netflix was the first to introduce households to TV-on-tap in 2007, entering popular culture with its avalanche of output, and even spawning the phrase \"Netflix and chill\" as a euphemism for staying in to have sex. But since then many other streaming services have followed Netflix\'s lead, including HBO, Disney, Apple and Amazon, making it an increasingly crowded market. \"What made Netflix so popular initially was not necessarily its original programming, but the shows it licensed from other production companies, like Friends, giving viewers one convenient place to watch everything they love,\" says entertainment journalist Tufayel Ahmed. \"With companies now taking their shows off the service and putting them on their own streaming platforms, Netflix faces the problem of having to fill the gap.\" They\'ve done that, launching some hugely successful original output, from the lurid regency romp Bridgerton to the brutal Squid Game, high school comedy Sex Education to the touching drama Afterlife.  Sixteen million people signed up in three months at the start of 2020 as coronavirus spread the world and discussing the dubious morality of Tiger King or the historical accuracy of The Crown was a way to switch off from the horror show of the news. But with so many rivals, \"all of which are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into competing with Netflix\",  says Mr Ahmed, it was almost inevitable the company would eventually lose some ground. Mark Mulligan, media analyst at MIDiA Research agrees, pointing to a trend for \"savvy switchers\" to skip between services. \"Everyone had more time and cash during the pandemic which meant the market was artificially buoyant,\" he says. But now he thinks: \"The economy for people\'s attention has peaked and the amount of spare time people have has run out\".  There is also a cost of living crisis to contend with, right around the world. And Netflix, rather than lowering prices has raised them, a move that should help shore up the balance sheet, but has proved unpopular with subscribers, who are themselves feeling the pinch, like 38-year-old Natalie Walters from Catford in South-East London. She hasn\'t cancelled, but she\'s switched from the premium service, which in the UK costs £15.99 a month, to the standard version at £10.99. \"It becomes about choosing what you keep and what you have to cut down or get rid of altogether,\" she says. And 55-year-old Peter Biggins, a coordinator from Norwich has done the same. \"I\'ve been with them from the beginning. They have some good shows, but they\'re not the only player in the market now,\" he says. And he\'s not a fan of the other plan Netflix is reported to be contemplating: cracking down on customers who share passwords with other households. \"If Netflix is going to go after people who have a subscription, they\'re going to annoy them,\" Mr Biggins predicts. And it may not have the outcome they\'re hoping for.  Aram Asai Munoz, a law student in Santiago, Chile, has shared a Netflix account with his parents and sister, who live in separate households, for several years.  Since he first signed up - eager to tune in to crime drama Better Call Saul - the monthly cost of the service has roughly doubled, he says.  Many of his friends have already cancelled over the price hikes and quality of content and he says he might well do the same if the firm does clamp down on password sharing - after all Netflix is a \"frivolity\" compared to the other bills that need paying, he says. \"Netflix somehow expects that by forbidding password sharing people will become direct new customers, but economic reality dictates the opposite: they will simply walk away from the service,\" he says. While unpopular with customers, the new strategy of raising prices and clamping down on password sharing could give the company some headroom, says Julian Aquilina, senior TV analyst at the media research firm Enders Analysis, alongside a plan to offer a cheaper service supported by advertising. But the impact will be limited. A survey of US Netflix users found only 11% used a shared log in. Some 85% were paid subscribers and the rest were on free trials, Kagan Consumer Insights found. That doesn\'t mean Netflix is about to lose too much ground, though, Mr Aquilina says. \"It is not like it is going to fade away anytime soon. It is a great product, people like using it,\" he says. \"The question is, how many more people it will reach in the future. Maybe it won\'t be as much as people expected - it seems those expectations are being reset.\" $50bn wiped off Netflix’s value as subscribers quit TikTok helps UK book sales hit record levels Households cancel streaming services to cut costs Netflix adds 16 million sign-ups in lockdown boost', '23 hours ago'),

They\'ve probably had it in their diary for months. But for the uninitiated, Heartstopper is a young adult LGBTQ+ story about two teenage boys, Charlie and Nick, who fall for each other at a secondary school, and their friends, Elle, Tao and Isaac. Charlie and Nick - played by newcomer Joe Locke and Rocketman actor Kit Connor - are subjected to homophobic bullying by Nick\'s so-called friends. Elle (Yasmin Finney), a transgender teen, has recently moved from the boys\' grammar school where all her friends are, to the girls\' equivalent, after also suffering cruel taunts. Finney, who has a built up a big following on TikTok, posting about her experiences of being a young, black transgender woman in the UK, endured difficulties at school herself. \"For me, school was the same. There\'s always been [these] voices of toxic masculinity that just clearly aren\'t educated enough. And even if they are, they just want to... have a laugh, but there\'s a point where it crosses the line and I think that\'s what Heartstopper highlights. It goes on every day in high school.  \"I actually started TikTok when I was in my second high school after I moved from my first because I was bullied. What I find is that the people that bullied me in high school, they\'re not really doing much with their lives now. And I\'m actually doing great!\" Locke, who is taking his A-level exams in a couple of weeks, says he was \"very lucky\" with his school experience. \"My school is great and I was never bullied. Once you get to sixth form, things really change because a lot of the people who would be the ones saying things aren\'t there anymore, or people have grown up and realise they don\'t really care anymore, they can just be themselves.\" But he acknowledges it\'s not easy for everyone. \"In general in high school, it\'s really hard. To be different in any way. And if you don\'t fit in with the tracky-wearing, vape-smoking norm, then you\'re likely to be pulled up on that and and seen to be different. \"I think what\'s beautiful about our show is that it celebrates these differences. You may think you\'re the weird one but actually everyone except those few tiny \'norm-fitting\' people are the weird ones. And even they\'re probably only [like] that because they feel that\'s what they have to do to fit in.\" He adds: \"It\'s just as sad for them... because they\'ve been conditioned to feel that\'s how they have to be to fit in and live in our society.\" Social media also has a part to play, of course - in Heartstopper, many of the awkward or delicate conversations between the characters take place online. While it can be a place of support, having a high profile on social media can also open you up to unwarranted abuse. Finney, from Manchester, says you have to be bold to put yourself out there and know when to take a break. \"I think you have to take risks. I\'ve always known that I want to be somebody that other people can look up at, especially the queer youth who don\'t necessarily know where they fit in in society.  And I\'ve always loved documenting my experience as a trans person from the age of 15, 16.\" (She\'s now 18, as is Locke).  Having curated an \"amazing following over the last three years,\" Finney stepped back from TikTok while filming Heartstopper, which is her first professional acting project. \"I just wanted a break. I think sometimes you just have to step away. When I was doing TikToks back in 2019, and 2020, I would compare myself at some points... to everybody else. I just wanted to focus on myself and make sure that I\'m okay mentally.  \"You\'ve just got to have a positive mindset on social media and realise that most of it isn\'t real, most of it is fake. It can be quite overwhelming. But I\'ve learned to harness that... and it\'s definitely made me stronger. I love seeing my community doing well.\" Locke also believes social media is a \"double-edged sword\". \"On one side, it\'s a lot of interaction for our generation and a lot of socialising. On the other hand, it can be overwhelming. There are times where I just have to turn my phone off. It\'s being aware of your boundaries. \"Netflix have been really good in helping us come to terms with what the next few weeks might be like,\" he adds. Writer Oseman has also taken time out from updating the Heartstopper web comic due to \"burnout and intense stress\".  Finney says: \"It\'s always about just knowing your limits. Alice is such a hard worker, and I\'m glad that they\'re taking a break. \"Everything they\'ve done is just magical and to see that reaction to their work coming to life and seeing the characters fit the mould of what they made back in 2012... it\'s amazing.\" Locke tells me Oseman was on set every day and it was \"like having a bible of Heartstopper right there\". He adds: \"I think it\'s really amazing to have a queer show that\'s aimed at a younger audience than say, It\'s A Sin, and it\'s very much a show that I think a lot of people would have wanted when they were younger.\" Finney is particularly pleased to see herself - a young black trans woman - reflected in a major new TV drama. A recent report found LGBT representation on US TV - including on streaming platforms available in the UK -  is at a high, with nearly 12% of regular characters who are LGBT, up 2.8% from last year. The numbers come from a study by LGBT media advocacy group GLAAD. But the study also found there were shortfalls and missing opportunities to tell a wider range of stories about LGBT characters. The Where We Are on TV analysis looked at overall diversity of shows, including those on big streaming platforms such as Netflix, Amazon,  Apple+ and Disney+. \"Acting has always been something that I\'ve wanted to do, but I\'ve just not really seen myself reflected in the media as a black trans woman, especially in the UK. I just could never see myself in the industry... [or] see myself doing well.  \"But it\'s just been crazy how amazing the response has been for Heartstopper and just how needed... trans actors and actresses are in the industry. And I\'m so happy to be part of that world.\" The debate about authentic casting is still ongoing - should gay roles only be played by gay actors, for example? Finney thinks they should. \"It\'s important... so the LGBT community can have a seat at the table. It\'s about representation.  If you had trans people playing cis roles it would be even but right now, and for years and years, we\'ve had cis people play trans characters.  \"Eddie Redmayne won an Oscar for The Danish Girl and then later apologised for it because he realised it\'s a bigger conversation. It\'s more about inclusivity,\" she says. In fact, Redmayne didn\'t actually apologise but he did say he regretted taking the role. \"For so many years, especially trans people, we\'ve just kind of been laughed at through entertainment. Queer people, trans people -  we\'ve been around for generations and millennials,\" Finney says. \"It\'s about the industry realising that they were wrong and they do need this representation.\" Heartstopper is on Netflix from 22 April.

In the scene, Saint West, six, shows his mother a \"Kim Kardashian experience\" room he apparently stumbled across while playing the game. Roblox said it removed the room and banned its creator - and no sex tape was ever available. It also said only \"a few dozen players\" found it in the short time it was live. On social media and in some news reports, people have suggested the chances of Saint West being one of those who found it are slim.  One well known independent Roblox developer known as Zomebody told BBC News: \"The chances of \'accidentally\' stumbling upon a game like that are astronomically small. \"There are two potential ways for Saint to have found such a game - either he or the family actively searched for (or even created) such a game or someone else in their group of peers created it and then shared it directly with the boy.\" Neither the Kardashians nor the production company, Fulwell 73, provided an on-the-record comment but a source close to the family insisted the scene was not falsified. Fifty million players worldwide log in to Roblox every day to explore, play mini-games and create their own experiences. There are millions of player-generated experiences and mini games, with new features added daily.  The most popular experiences are showcased to Roblox players through a curated home screen but others can be found using the search function. The vast majority of these zones are not advertised to players and do not receive many visitors.  The moment Saint West finds the Roblox room is a central driver of the drama in the first episode of the new show, The Kardashians, a reboot of the long-running Keeping Up With the Kardashian\'s reality show.  He is seen running up to his mother, saying: \"Everybody look it, this is on Roblox,\" before handing her his tablet computer.  The tablet screen is blurred but Kim Kardashian describes what she saw to an interviewer: \"There was a picture of my cry face and I look at it and it said something super-inappropriate like, \'Kim\'s new sex tape\'. This is supposed to be unreleased footage from my old sex tape.\" A sex tape of Kim Kardashian was published online in 2007. Later in the episode, using strong language, she threatens to sue Roblox telling her lawyer she has \"all the time, all the money and all the resources to burn them to the... ground\". Roblox, which is valued at about $24bn (£18bn), said it took action against the content as soon as its moderators were alerted in September 2021.

The Spanish champions, who won the treble last season, went 2-0 up within 10 minutes thanks to goals from Aitana Bonmati and Caroline Graham Hansen. Jenni Hermoso and captain Alexia Putellas then doubled Barcelona\'s lead. Wolfsburg\'s Jill Roord pulled one back in the second half, before Putellas\' penalty made it 5-1. Two-time champions Wolfsburg were blown away by early pressure from Barcelona, who set the previous record mark for a women\'s match when they played in front of 91,553 for their quarter-final victory against El Clasico rivals Real Madrid last month. The Nou Camp was treated to a scintillating display from the defending champions as Bonmati, who went off to a standing ovation in the second half, punished the German side when she was played in behind within three minutes. Fridolina Rolfo almost scored another seconds later when she fired inches wide and Wolfsburg had still not got going when Graham Hansen cut onto her left foot and curled it into the corner to make it 2-0. The visitors did come close when Svenja Huth was teed up by Roord, only for the Wolfsburg striker to be denied by a goalline block and a save within quick succession. Barcelona pushed to extend their lead - adding a third and fourth goal before half-time when Hermoso coolly put away Maria Torrejon\'s cut-back and Putellas was slipped in behind. Further chances fell to Tollejon, Putellas and Rolfo, while Ana-Maria Crnogorcevic had a goal ruled out for offside following a VAR check early in the second half, Claudia Pina hit the crossbar and substitute Asisat Oshoala was denied from close range.

Blair Alston\'s 89th-minute winner completed the turnaround after the hosts fell behind before half-time. James Craigen\'s early goal seemed to have given Arbroath the title momentum, but Ash Taylor\'s stabbed equaliser set up a tense finish. The Ayrshire side return to the top flight at the first time of asking. The result takes Kilmarnock four points clear at the top, uncatchable with just one game remaining. The maroon smoke drifted across the pitch from the away end as a raucous atmosphere engulfed a packed Rugby Park - a mood that has been missing since Steve Clarke\'s tenure. The first-half played into Arbroath\'s hands, with Kilmarnock registering just two shots in the first 45 minutes and the visitors took advantage of the hosts\' poor play, charging up the pitch on the counter with Scott Stewart slipping it to Craigen. The former Partick Thistle man, who secured the Jags\' promotion to the top flight in 2013 with a goal against Morton, looked like he\'d fluffed his shot but the ball crept into the bottom corner to send Arbroath two points clear at the the top on the night. Luke Donnelly, who helped set up the first goal, almost doubled Arbroath\'s lead just before half-time, getting on the end of a Michael McKenna cross and flicking past the keeper, but it wasn\'t on target and Kilmarnock cleared. The second-half was a much different affair, with Kilmarnock suddenly acutely aware of the task at hand after a nervous and timid opening exchange. The hosts ramped up the pressure as Derek Gaston denied Oli Shaw before Kyle Lafferty and Taylor both saw headers drift high and wide. The Northern Irish striker - who battled referee John Beaton more often than the Arbroath back-line - did have the ball in the back of the net at one point, but he was about five yards offside at the time. With 13 minutes remaining, Kilmarnock took their chance. Fraser Murray nodded a header at goal with Gaston saving instinctively, but it dropped to the feet of Taylor who stabbed at goal and Nicky Low could only clear the ball into the roof of his own net. Despite that set-back, the Arbroath shot stopper was doing his utmost to keep his side in the title race denying Murray twice with acrobatic efforts. There was little he could do to stop the winning goal. Arbroath were caught flat footed as Kilmarnock launched a counter of their own, with  Alston rolling the ball into the bottom corner from the edge of the box to spark scenes of jubilation.  Kilmarnock manager Derek McInnes spoke to BBC Scotland: \"What a way to win it. It was no more than we deserved.  \"I thought Arbroath were the better team in the first half. I thought we were too pumped up, too erratic, too excitable. \"The perseverance of the team was clear, the winning mentality of the team was brilliant and to score so late on was fantastic. I\'m absolutely delighted for so many people but it shows what this place can be. \"We battered Arbroath second-half.

Sultan, 31, was a late replacement after fellow Filipino and title holder John Riel Casimero was unable to fight. Butler, 33, took the belt with scores of 116-112, 118-110 and 117-111 at the M&S Bank Arena. \"I had 48 hours to get a game plan together,\" said Butler. The WBO could decide to upgrade Butler\'s title to full world championship status, which would make him a two-time world champion after he held the IBF belt in 2014. \"It\'s unbelievable. What a feeling. I\'ve waited a long time to become a two-time world champion,\" he said. Butler was first scheduled to meet Casimero in Dubai in December 2021, but the fight fell through when Casimero failed to make weight. They were then due to meet on Friday, but Casimero breached British Boxing Board of Control rules by using a sauna to lose weight in close proximity to a fight. Butler made a bright start against Sultan, producing a great variety of punches and finding the target with combinations as Sultan struggled to land anything substantial. Sultan started the sixth well, but Butler, utilising fine footwork and solid boxing skills, kept making his opponent lunge in and miss. Sultan had some success at the end of the eighth and had his best round in the ninth, but could not build on that as Butler regained control to secure a dominant victory. Promoters Probellum earlier this week denied any link with Daniel Kinahan, the Irish cartel leader who has been hit with worldwide financial sanctions by the US for alleged drug trafficking and money laundering. Probellum president Richard Schaefer said \"at no time was there any financial, managerial or board involvement\" between Probellum and MTK Global, the promotion company co-founded by Kinahan. Schaefer told BBC Sport that any fighter on Probellum\'s books must cut ties with Kinahan or the company would not promote them.

Fury, 33, hit the scales at 18st 12lb, while challenger Whyte weighed in at 18st 1lb. The two Britons will fight in front of 94,000 fans - a post-war British record - with Fury making a second defence of the title he won against Deontay Wilder in February 2020. Fury\'s drop in weight from the final bout in the Wilder trilogy in October gives a slight indication as to how he may approach the fight.  Against Wilder, Fury went toe-to-toe with the big-punching American. Weighing in lighter suggests Fury may revert back to fighting at range and using his quick feet and movement to outbox Whyte. Whyte, dressed in all black, took to the stage first and was dealt a chorus of boos by the Fury-friendly crowd at BoxPark in Wembley. The 34-year-old\'s self-imposed media silence before the fight left many wondering what shape he would come in, but Whyte looked in good condition and is 6lb heavier than when he knocked out Alexander Povetkin in March 2021. Fury then made his way to the scales. Wearing a white, blue and red tracksuit, the \'Gypsy King\' paraded his WBC belt to a pumped-up crowd. The fighters have shared several social media spats over the years but, just as it was at Wednesday\'s media conference, there was a jovial atmosphere with no signs of any bad blood. They jokingly tickled each other, shook hands and then swapped baseball caps. Fury and Whyte almost resembled a double act and gave in the demands of an audience wanting an encore when they returned to the stage. They danced in unison to some music, throwing their hands in the air while bouncing on the spot.  On Wednesday Fury and Whyte calmed down their respective entourages when matters got heated between the two teams. At the weigh-in, Team Fury and Team Whyte reconciled as the fighters\' brothers embraced on stage. All media commitments and obligatory fight week events are done. The next time these two men lock eyes will be inside the ropes on Saturday evening.

Chair of the Women and Equality Committee Caroline Nokes said pharmacy supplies of oestrogen gel had run out in her Hampshire constituency. One manufacturer has reported exceptionally high demand for its gel in recent months.  The government said alternatives were available to women.  Oestrogel manufacturer Besins Healthcare says it is working to meet the increased needs by doubling the amount it can supply.  Some women in Northern Ireland are borrowing each other\'s HRT medication due to supply shortages, according to a menopause support group. During business questions in the House of Commons on Thursday, Ms Nokes called for a debate to ensure \"we can get the supplies that we need\". She said: \"Pharmacies in Romsey and Southampton North have completely run out, which leaves women of a certain age - and before my honourable friend from North Dorset makes a comment... yes, I declare an interest - without access to the oestrogen gel, which enables us to sleep and to work competently.\" Millions of women in the UK experience menopause symptoms such as hot flushes, low mood and anxiety. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can help with this. It\'s a taboo issue which has been raised by TV presenter Davina McCall, as well as other high-profile celebrities. She campaigned for prescription costs to be cut to help more women access the treatment.  In October, the Government announced new policies related to menopause support, including changes to prescription charges.  It said the cost of repeat prescriptions for HRT would be significantly reduced in England. That means women will be able to pay £18.70 once a year - saving up to £200 annually. However, Pharmacy Minister Maria Caulfield recently said the move would not be enacted until April 2023. The Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPS) condemned the delay, saying it will \"frustrate many\".  Chair of RPS in England, Thorrun Govind, said: \"Women experiencing the menopause need support to stay well and remain in the workplace. For some, HRT prescriptions are an essential part of this, but also a financial drain during a cost-of-living crisis. \"We believe everyone should have access to the medicines they need, regardless of ability to pay, and will continue to call on the Government to scrap prescription charges in England altogether.\" HRT has grown in popularity, and prescriptions have more than doubled in England since 2017. Some 583,000 prescriptions were made in December 2021 alone, across all NHS GP practices in England.  The British Menopause Society advises women who are experiencing difficulty obtaining oestrogen gel to consider other HRT preparations, even if they are not an exact match.  It said the pandemic had made accessing treatment harder for some.  Dr Nighat Arif, who is a GP, told BBC\'s Women\'s Hour: \"We have been struggling to get supply of Oestrogel.\" She said the treatment was a lifeline for some women, preventing HRT symptoms and protecting their health.  She said she was prescribing alternative treatments, but that was time-consuming and could be distressing and problematic for the patient. \"They are slightly different and they might not be suitable for that individual.\" Women \'borrow menopause drugs due to shortage\' HRT: Davina McCall hails \'brilliant day for women\'', '12 hours ago'),

The team says the unprecedented amount of data allowed them to uncover new patterns in the DNA of cancer - hinting at causes that are not yet understood. They add that the genetic clues will ultimately help improve diagnosis and treatment. The research is published in Science. Cancer can be thought of as a corrupted version of our own healthy cells - mutations to our DNA change our cells until eventually they grow and divide uncontrollably. Traditionally many cancers have been categorised by doctors based on where they are in the body and the type of cells involved -  but whole genome sequencing can provide another layer of key information. Whole genome sequencing is relatively new, but is already available on the NHS for a small number of specific cancers, including some blood cancers. The NHS long-term plan aims to make it more widely available, through the NHS Genomic Medicine Service. Lead researcher Prof Serena Nik-Zainal, a consultant at Cambridge University Hospitals, told the BBC the study was like an \"archaeological dig\" of people\'s cancer. She added: \"We can see the patterns or imprints in the field of their cancers - like dinosaur footprints - of what is going wrong with their cancers.  \"And everyone\'s cancer is different. To know we can personalise each person\'s cancer report means we are a step closer to personalising treatment for them.\" Led by the University of Cambridge, the research team analysed anonymised DNA data provided by the 100,000 Genomes Project - an England-wide project to sequence the whole genomes of patients affected by cancer and rare diseases.  With thousands of genetic changes seen in each tumour they analysed, researchers were able to detect specific combinations of genetic alterations - so-called \"mutational signatures\" - that may be key to cancers developing.   Comparing the data to other international genetic cancer projects, they confirmed patterns that are already known, and uncovered 58 new ones. This video can not be played Some signatures can provide clues about whether patients have had exposure to environmental causes of cancers - such as smoking. Others provide more information about genetic abnormalities that may be amenable to specific drugs, researchers say.  Researchers also created a computer programme to help scientists and doctors check whether patients who have had whole genome sequencing have any of the newly discovered mutational clues. Aubrey, a two-year-old girl from Bedfordshire, was diagnosed with cancer when she was only 16 months old.  She did not take part in the study. But whole genome sequencing helped doctors identify the type of cancer she has - a rhabdomyosarcoma - a rare cancer that generally affects muscles attached to bones. The results helped make sure she is on the best treatment.  Anna, Aubrey\'s mother, said: \"Because of the unusual way Aubrey\'s cancer presented, the doctors were not sure of the exact cancer type.  \"The whole genome sequence test helped doctors to know how to treat her and keep her stable.  \"Whilst we still have a challenging journey with Aubrey\'s diagnosis and treatment, we are relieved to know she does not have cancer that was inherited, and we do not have to worry that it could affect our son or other members of the family as well.\" Source: NHS England Prof Matt Brown, chief scientific officer of Genomics England, said: \"Mutational signatures are an example of using the full potential of whole genome sequencing.  \"We hope to use the mutational clues seen in this study and apply them back into our patient population, with the ultimate aim of improving diagnosis and management of cancer patients.\" The research is supported by Cancer Research UK.

The unnamed individual had other underlying medical conditions and died in hospital in 2021.  Persistent infections such as this are still rare, say the London medics.  Most people naturally clear the virus, but the patient in question had a severely weakened immune system.  Chronic infections like these need studying to improve our understanding of Covid and the risks it can pose, say experts. The patient first caught Covid in early 2020. They had symptoms and the infection was confirmed with a PCR test.  They were in and out of hospital many times over the next 72 weeks, for both routine checks and care.  On each occasion - about 50 in all - they tested positive, meaning they still had Covid.  The doctors, from King\'s College London and Guy\'s and St Thomas\' NHS Foundation Trust, say detailed lab analysis revealed it was the same, persistent infection, rather than repeated bouts.  The patient could not shake the infection, even after being given antiviral drugs.  This is different to \"long Covid\", where symptoms persist after the infection has gone. One of the medics who will be presenting the findings at a medical conference - the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases - is Dr Luke Blagdon Snell.  He told the BBC: \"These were throat swab tests that were positive each time. The patient never had a negative test. And we can tell it was one continuous infection because the genetic signature of it - the information we got from sequencing the viral genome - was unique and constant in that patient.\" Prolonged infections are rare but important, say the researchers, because they might give rise to new variants of Covid - although that did not happen in this case, or other ones that they studied. Dr Snell said: \"The virus is still adapting to the human host when people are infected for a long time. It might provide an opportunity for Covid to accrue new mutations.  \"Some of these patients that we have studied have mutations that have been seen in some of the variants of concern.\" He stressed that none of the nine patients they checked had spawned a new dangerous variant.  Someone with a chronic infection might not be contagious to others, he added. Dr David Strain from the University of Exeter Medical School, said: \"We know that every time the virus replicates, it must reproduce its RNA - equivalent to manually copying a text book. We know if we were to transcribe an entire book we would make mistakes, so too does the virus. Every copy will produce mutations.  \"Although Omicron did not arise in these particular individuals, this demonstrates a very clear pathway by which vaccine resistant variants may arise. Whereas with BA.2 we have got lucky, that the mutation is associated with a less severe illness, there is no guarantee that the next iteration will be the same.\" The man who tested positive for Covid 43 times \'I\'ve had long Covid for two years now\' Woman caught Covid twice within record 20 days ECCMID 2022', '22 hours ago'),

They say it is increasingly likely a virus which causes flu symptoms, known as adenovirus, could be the cause. Officials are examining 79 confirmed cases in England, 14 in Scotland and 15 across Wales and Northern Ireland. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said eight children had received a liver transplant as a result. The first sign of an unusual rise in young children with liver inflammation was spotted in Scotland in late March. Most of the children hospitalised so far are thought to be between the ages of one and five years old.  UKHSA\'s chief medical advisor, Professor Susan Hopkins, says that officials were still looking at a range of possible factors that could be behind the increase, but \"the most likely\" trigger was an adenovirus - a group of common viruses which usually cause colds, vomiting and diarrhoea in children. \"Transplants in this age group are extremely rare so therefore we are concerned, and we want to understand why this is happening and what else we can do,\" she told the BBC. Prof Hopkins says 77% of childhood hepatitis cases currently under investigation have tested positive for some form of adenovirus.  Scientists and clinicians are now investigating whether there has been a change in the genetic make-up - or genome - of the virus that might trigger liver inflammation more easily. Another possible explanation is that restrictions imposed in the pandemic may have led to young children being first exposed to adenovirus at a slightly later point in their lives, leading to a \"more vigorous\" immune response. The UKHSA says it is keeping an \"open mind\" and not ruling out other possible causes, including Covid-19, other infections or an environmental trigger. But it says there is \"no link\" with the Covid-19 vaccine, as none of the children involved has been vaccinated. To minimise the chance of an infection, Prof Hopkins says parents should supervise good handwashing and hygiene at home.  \"The good things that we\'ve learnt from reducing transmission of Covid will help us reduce the transmission of whatever is causing this as well,\" she says. The UKHSA has told parents and guardians to be on the lookout for the signs of hepatitis such as jaundice - a yellowing of the eyes and skin - and contact a GP if they are concerned. Other symptoms of the liver condition include: Earlier this week, the European Centre for Disease Control said an undisclosed number of childhood hepatitis cases had also been detected in Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands and Spain.  In the US, Alabama\'s public-health department said nine cases had been found in one- to six-year-olds, with two needing liver transplants. It\'s a broad term used to describe inflammation of the liver. Usually the result of a viral infection, it can also be caused by exposure to some chemicals, drinking too much alcohol, drugs and certain genetic disorders. There are five main types of hepatitis caused by specific viruses - known as A, B, C, D and E - but none of those  so far appears to have caused the liver inflammation seen in these children. Some types of hepatitis can pass without any serious problems, while others can be long-lasting.

The sixth-former from Gorslas, Carmarthenshire, said her period education had been \"pretty shocking\".   It comes as a Swansea University study found menstrual cycle education needed to be addressed in schools.   The Welsh government said period education would become mandatory as part of a new curriculum. The other UK nations said they have taken action.  Efa said she remembers having a puberty lesson in the final year of primary school and, at the end, the boys were sent out.  \"You just get told \'oh, by the way at some point you\'re going to be bleeding for three-eight days once a month\',\" she said.  \"There was no education about why, or symptoms before or after or hormone changes.\" She said she and her friends educated themselves online more than they learned in the classroom.  \"I just don\'t feel like the education system has changed at all since when my mam was younger,\" she added.  Lili Mai, 17, said her class was not really given information about why they had periods. \"There was no deeper explanation, we weren\'t talking about pain or cramps, anything that comes with it. I had to figure that out as I went along,\" she said.  Ffion, 17, from Ammanford, said she doesn\'t remember much about the lesson, other than a stranger coming into class.  \"We weren\'t educated on tampons, menstrual cups... it was just the basics that led to problems years on when I started my periods. It\'s just really sad,\" she added.  It\'s a story Natalie Brown is familiar with.  She works with elite female athletes looking at the impact of their periods and their cycle on performance.  It was their lack of knowledge that led her to question what was being taught in schools.  \"What we very much find is actually there is minimal education in school,\" she added. The academic led the report by Swansea University, funded by Sport Wales, looking at menstrual cycle education in the UK.   The sport scientist said more than 90% of teachers that responded to the survey were female and often they drew on their own personal experiences.   The report recommended giving teachers more time, training and support to deliver classes regularly as well as providing more information on the emotional and social aspects of the menstrual cycle.  It also found that teachers felt periods affected attendance, participation in exercise, as well as behaviour and confidence.  \"To me that shows it is an area that we need to support girls more on because it can have an effect on school performance, exam results... these kind of longer-term health and wellbeing benefits,\" she added.  Kathryn King runs the Bloody Honest social media account which she said aims to fill the gaps in period education.  She said the responses she gets to her videos highlight the desperate need for information.  \"One of the most common questions I get is \'where\'s my vagina and how many holes do I have?\' \"It\'s baffling to me that there\'s such a gap in the knowledge of young people and it\'s just filled by friends or family if they\'re lucky... and, if not, strangers on the internet,\" she said.  The 26 year old has no medical training but felt the urge to educate others about periods after learning about her own in her early 20s.  \"The more you know, the sooner you can recognise any abnormalities for you... and the sooner you can speak to a doctor and have that checked and potentially that is life changing,\" she said. The Welsh government said, within the new curriculum framework, teachers will be able to focus on a wide range of health and wellbeing topics.  \"It is important that learning about menstrual wellbeing is not simply a \'one-off lesson\' which is why the Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) Code sets out that it should be taught at various stages of the curriculum,\" it added.  The Scottish government said learning about periods and menstruation started in primary schools and was an important part of health and wellbeing education.  \"Local authorities and schools can use a wide range of resources to deliver age and stage appropriate lessons,\" it said.  In Northern Ireland, the government said period education was provided to both primary and post-primary schools.   \"Pupils have the opportunity to learn about scientific facts and engage in open conversation,\" it said. \"This can help to break down common taboos about periods, prevent stigma and reduce negative perceptions and behaviours.\"   The UK government said pupils in England should learn about periods, including its impact on physical and mental health, as a mandatory part of the curriculum.  \"We have invested millions in rolling out the curriculum and are supporting teachers with training and guidance, so that they can gain the knowledge to teach it confidently and foster open conversations with their students,\" it said.

The Gunners sit three points and a place above old rivals United in the table and will look to leapfrog Tottenham Hotspur and into the Champions League spots with a win at the Emirates. Mikel Arteta’s side sparked new life into their campaign with a 4-2 away win at Chelsea on Wednesday, after a run of three defeats threatened to end their hopes.  United are now looking to produce a similar result, following their humiliating 4-0 defeat to Liverpool in midweek, and three points would get Ralf Rangnick’s side back in the race. United have this week announced that Erik ten Hag will become the club’s next permanent manager at the end of the season and securing Champions League qualification would be a boost to the Dutchman’s project at Old Trafford.  The size of the task facing Ten Hag was made clear by United’s performance at Anfield and there will be a number of players in Rangnick’s squad who could now be fighting for their own futures at the club. Both these teams have struggled for consistency in recent weeks and a draw would do little for either side, with Tottenham facing Brentford in tonight’s later game. Follow live updates from Arsenal vs Manchester United below: United’s defence fell apart there with back passes missing its target Varane. A shot came in but De Gea saved. However, the keeper couldn’t get back to also cover Tavares’ shot. Incredible start for Arsenal and a great moment for Tavares who scores his first Gunners goal. United now in possession to try and get a foot into this match. Oh no United, the defence have had a howler and Tavares bounces after De Gea is forced to make a save. What an awful start from the visitors. Here we go then! Who will improve their chances of securing Champions League qualification? We will soon find out as the players get underway at the Emirates. Both managers have been speaking to BT Sport ahead of the match. Ralf Rangnick said: “We owe it to ourselves and our supoorters to show the best of us today. “We [Rangnick and Ronaldo] spoke on the day when he returned to training. He said everything is well, I can play and train again.” And on Maguire being dropped to the bench: “That [the bomb threat] is not the only reason. He has had a tough week that is why I have decided to give him a break today.” While Mikel Arteta added: “That game [against Chelsea] is gone. United is where our focus is and we can play in front of our people.” Interim manager Ralf Rangnick has warned Manchester United need “open-heart surgery” if they are to kick on under successor Erik ten Hag. Placed in interim charge following Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s exit in November, the highly-rated German coach has found it difficult to get a consistent tune out of the Red Devils’ stuttering stars. Rangnick’s short-term focus comes with a long-term appreciation of what is needed for United, who may have made a “good choice” in appointing Ajax boss Ten Hag as permanent manager but still need to do much more. “I’m pretty convinced that he’s the best possible coach that you could get right now,” the interim manager said. Read the full story: The 63-year-old has not held back about the chasm to the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City Well what a cracking match we have on our hands this afternoon. It’s a battle for the top four match with the Gunners just three points ahead of the Red Devils. But it is Arsenal who will feel more confident heading into the fixture. They defeated Chelsea at Stamford Bridge earlier this week while United fell to a 4-0 loss to Liverpool. Arsenal could temporarily move into fourth with a win over United as Tottenham are playing at 5.30pm. It will put pressure on their rivals if they bag three points as Spurs would then have to defeat Brentford to reclaim the Champions League spot. Everything will play out at the Emirates in 20 minutes time. Ralf Rangnick will still be in charge of United for the remainder of the season as they look to usurp Arsenal in the battle for Champions League qualification. Asked directly about Ten Hag’s appointment, Arteta added: “I think he’s been really good, what he did a couple of years ago in the Champions League, especially the way his teams play. It’s a Man United decision, there’s nothing more to say. “For us there is no impact (on Saturday’s fixture), for them I don’t know what’s going to happen but for us nothing changes.” Pogba is one of a number of players that are set to leave during a summer of change that will be overseen by newly-appointed manager Ten Hag. Edinson Cavani, Jesse Lingard and Juan Mata are others that are out of contract, while Nemanja Matic has already confirmed he is leaving. There are also a number of frustrated peripheral figures at the club, including Eric Bailly. The defender appears to be United’s fifth-choice centre-back and seemingly suggested on Instagram that he should play alongside Raphael Varane instead of Harry Maguire in Saturday’s Premier League match at Arsenal. “I’m not on Instagram and I’m not communicating on Instagram, not at all,” Rangnick said. “Listen, I’m not talking about my players now in the press conference not knowing what has happened. This doesn’t make sense. “But I can only tell you, never in my life and I will not be part of Instagram, Facebook or whatever. “If this is really true what you just told me, then I think it’s not the right sign. This should not happen in a football team, no matter in which league.” Ralf Rangnick believes Paul Pogba has played his last match for Manchester United. The 29-year-old came through the Old Trafford youth set-up and rejoined the club in 2016 following a successful stint at Juventus for a then world-record fee. But Pogba’s return has not worked out how either party would want and the World Cup winner looks set to leave United this summer when his contract expires. There is little sign of him agreeing a new deal, meaning the 10 minutes he managed before limping off with a calf injury in Tuesday’s 4-0 meek loss at Liverpool are likely to be his last for the club. Rangnick says Pogba is facing a minimum of four weeks on the sidelines, which would bring an underwhelming period to a fitting conclusion. “It doesn’t make sense right now (to talk about his characterisation as a player),” the interim boss said when asked if the midfielder was an enigma. “He’s injured. He’s a player who won the World Cup with France. He’s such a good player that he was a regular starter for a team like France. “We all know what kind of potential he has and what kind of good player he can be. “But he was, quite like a few other players, just struggling to get his best performance sustainably on the pitch for a team like Manchester United. “This was not only the case this season or in the last couple of weeks, as far as I remember this was also the case in earlier years.” Paul Pogba went off injured at Anfield The Arsenal line-up sees Cedric coming in for Rob Holding at the back in the only change from the win over Chelsea on Wednesday. Eddie Nketiah keeps his place up top after his two goals against the Blues. For United, Cristiano Ronaldo comes back into the starting eleven up front in one of five changes. Harry Maguire is on the bench as Raphael Varane comes into the back four alongside Alex Telles.  Jadon Sancho starts on the right-hand side with Marcus Rashford dropping out.

(452, '/sport/football/liverpool-everton-premier-league-preview-anfield-b2063656.html', 2, 'independent', 'Local rivals Liverpool and Everton in different worlds ahead of derby', 'Roger Hunt picked himself up off the Goodison Park turf, both arms up in celebration. It was the first Merseyside derby for the best part of eight years - the first in the league for almost 12 - and the future World Cup winner scored a last-minute goal to ensure Liverpool took a point back across Stanley Park. That 2-2 draw in 1962 came in front of a crowd of 73,000. It helped promoted Liverpool settle back into the old Division 1 and begin a run of 60 consecutive top-eight finishes. The dropped point – as it then was – did not prevent Everton from becoming champions. That renewal of a rivalry has started to assume a different kind of significance. There are older derbies, though, as they first met in 1894, not many. But there are none in England which have appeared on the fixture list every season for the last six decades. Since Bill Shankly took Liverpool up, neither they nor Everton have been promoted or relegated. Sunday will bring up 120 league derbies in 60 years. “It comes around twice a year,” said Frank Lampard. It has, anyway. The 240th Merseyside derby might be the last for a while. It would leave a void. “I know what it means to so many people in the city and the supporters and clubs and this game is like a symbol of that,” said Lampard, who is preparing to experience his first. Jurgen Klopp would miss it, and not just because he has only lost once to Everton. “Of course,” he said, and not merely because of the undiplomatic caveat that: “I don’t know where we would be without the points against Everton.” More meaningfully, he noted: “We are used to the two clubs in the city [playing each other] and that is how it is. Usually the week before we play, all the talk is about the derby.” Maybe Manchester United spared Everton other scrutiny. The unflattering comparisons with Liverpool this week have instead been drawn with their other major historic rivals when they were thrashed 4-0 at Anfield. If Everton have become Merseyside’s answer to United – spending too much, achieving too little – now the stark contrasts between red and blue are unavoidable. Liverpool could win four trophies this season. Everton have only won four league games since the end of September. In 2022, Liverpool have triumphed at San Siro, the Estadio da Luz and Wembley. Everton have not even got a point on the road. Pep Guardiola has called Liverpool one of the best teams in history. Everton may go down as one of the worst in theirs, certainly statistically. They have outspent Liverpool during Farhad Moshiri’s ownership, which coincides with Klopp’s management of Liverpool. Some £550 million later, they are separated from their neighbours by half a mile and 47 points. They could enter next season as Champions League winners and Championship newcomers. They occupy the same part of the same city and, increasingly, different planets. “The reality is we are coming up against one of, if the not, the top team in the world,” Lampard reflected. Everton are English aristocracy, Liverpool a global superclub. For a long time, though, they were the club with more derby wins. In 1985, they dethroned Liverpool to become champions. A year later, Liverpool pipped Everton. There were two all-Merseyside FA Cup finals and a League Cup final between the two halves of Merseyside in the 1980s. They made a huge impression on a football-obsessed boy. They represented the pinnacle, the role models. Mohamed Salah scored twice in a 4-1 win at Goodison in December  “I was around seven years of age when Everton were winning league titles,” Lampard recalled. “And I remember being a West Ham fan. It was a good period for them in the mid-80s; in 1985-86, they had a chance of being around the [title] race. And for a young boy growing up a West Ham fan in Essex, it felt like there was a mystique and the level of the Liverpool clubs and there was a huge difference, a huge gap. “It was a great era for football. I remember going to watch Liverpool play and going: ‘Wow, it’s Kenny Dalglish.’ I remember watching people like [current director] Graeme Sharp, who obviously I work a bit with now and Andy Gray and that incredible aggressive but quality Everton team and everything they created around it. “So it was a big part of my thinking. It was part of the nostalgia when I got this job was understanding the size and history of the club so it was a big deal for me growing up. It was a great era for both the Liverpool clubs.” Lampard is the newcomer with an insight into Everton. “I understand it is a club steeped in history, that families and generations adore the club,” he said. Illustrations come everywhere. Lampard cited a chance meeting with a lady on the King’s Road in London, while having lunch with his wife, a couple of days after Everton beat Manchester United. “Evertonians have come out of everywhere so that has not been a reminder, I am aware of the size of this club, but it makes you proud.” Making them proud is altogether harder. This has become a one-sided rivalry. Evertonians have not seen their side win at Anfield since 1999; Carlo Ancelotti’s 2-0 victory there last year came behind closed doors. Yet Everton’s plight means that there are still greater considerations. “If we were sitting in eighth or tenth I could think about what this might mean,” added Lampard. “I could walk through the blue half of the city and it would be great the next day. At the moment, I am just thinking about the points.” Lampard must attempt to overturn Everton’s dismal away form at Anfield  Klopp argued: “I can’t remember when it was not important for both.” Yet it has rarely been more important at either end of the table; he referenced Everton’s worsening predicament. “I think the situation is becoming more and more difficult because of results, when Rafa [Benitez] was there, there was still some distance between Everton and the relegation zone and that has nothing to do with the way they played, it was just the way it developed. Obviously they have had some real injury problems this year, too. Obviously if you lose Dominic Calvert-Lewin or cannot use him for nearly a whole season, that is a massive blow. He is one of the best strikers in England, for sure.” But at times, he has been able to win without some of his own best players. Shankly’s old witticism that the two best teams on Merseyside were Liverpool and Liverpool reserves has acquired a truth. Everton were knocked out of the FA Cup by a glorified youth side in January 2020. The current Liverpool forward with most derby goals is not Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino or Sadio Mane but the perennial back-up Divock Origi. There is the chance Klopp will rest some of his premier players for a Champions League semi-final against Villarreal and still pick a side Everton can only envy. “It is a team that has just put four past Manchester United,” Lampard said. “It is an incredible team, an incredible squad with options.” Liverpool and Everton once dominated English football but this is now a one-sided rivalry  Everton’s attempts to stop them have encompassed the illegal. Virgil van Dijk’s 2020-21 season was ended prematurely by an awful challenge from Jordan Pickford last season. Thiago Alcantara was out for 10 weeks after a lunge that brought a red card for Richarlison. “I love intensity and physicality in football but there is a rule book and make sure we all stick to that and don’t go over the top,” Klopp counselled. Lampard concurred, while citing different reasons. “To get a result at Anfield is difficult enough,” he said. “With 10 men, it is nigh-on impossible.” Liverpool have found more legitimate ways of inflicting pain on Everton. Roberto Martinez’s demise was hastened by a 4-0 loss at Anfield, Marco Silva sacked the day after a 5-2 defeat to a weakened Liverpool team. As they could be on Sunday, Everton were in the relegation zone then. They had dropped more points at Anfield than Liverpool had dropped anywhere that season. In December, Benitez’s name was chorused by supporters as Liverpool won 4-1 at Goodison: by the Liverpool fans, that is. Enter Lampard, who has had many a duel with Liverpool as player and manager but is unburdened by history in this fixture. Given the gap, his praise for Liverpool is uncontroversial. “I am talking as a realist and the reality is if you watch Liverpool, particularly their recent form, nobody watching the first half against Manchester United could do anything but think: ‘Wow.’ If you love football, you love watching that. Speed, accuracy of pass, great quality levels, energy in the team: everything.” A few minutes earlier, he had been asked if he would take a draw on Sunday. “What do you think?” he replied. “Of course.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(454, '/sport/football/antonio-rudiger-chelsea-contract-news-b2063860.html', 2, 'independent', 'Chelsea hopeful takeover will lead to new Rudiger deal', 'Chelsea chiefs still hope to be able to strike a deal to keep Antonio Rudiger at Stamford Bridge beyond the summer. Germany defender Rudiger is understood to have drawn major interest from Real Madrid, Barcelona, Paris St Germain and Manchester United. The 29-year-old is out of contract at the end of the season and his representatives have talked to some of Europe’s biggest clubs about a possible switch from west London. Rudiger has for some time vowed to leave the decision on his future until the end of the campaign, but interest from other clubs has remained consistent. He is understood to want to continue working with Thomas Tuchel however, having hit new heights under the Blues’ German boss. Chelsea’s recruitment and retention has been halted by the strict operating terms after Roman Abramovich’s UK government sanctions. The sale of the Stamford Bridge club should be complete in May though, which will allow the west Londoners to return to standard transfer business. The consortiums bidding to buy the Blues are all understood to want to keep chairman Bruce Buck and director Marina Granovskaia in place after a purchase. And that potential stability could yet offer a route map for the Blues to retain Rudiger’s services. Former Roma centre-back Rudiger’s continued determination to keep his options open in recent weeks is understood to have been respected in the Chelsea hierarchy. Todd Boehly, Sir Martin Broughton and Steve Pagliuca are the consortium heads for the remaining bids to buy Chelsea, with New York merchant bank the Raine Group poised to select a preferred bidder in the coming days. Abramovich put Chelsea up for sale on 2 March, amid Russia’s continued invasion of Ukraine. The Russian-Israeli billionaire was then sanctioned by the UK government on 10 March, with Downing Street claiming to have proven his links to Vladimir Putin. Chelsea remain on course for a third-place finish in the Premier League, but will be itching to arrest a run of three-straight home losses in all competitions in Sunday’s clash with West Ham. David Moyes’ Hammers defeated Chelsea 3-2 at the London Stadium on 4 December, so will pitch up in west London with designs on a Premier League double. Blues boss Tuchel is determined to push his side back into form on home soil, but has admitted feeling the pace personally after a relentless few weeks. “I reflect on what signals we give; we only had two days in between coming from Wembley and an emotional game and win to the next match,” said Tuchel. “I felt very tired after the Real Madrid and the turnaround, Southampton away, Real Madrid away, and another away game at Wembley. I felt it, I was tired. “So should I have pushed harder? What signals did I give? We did what we were convinced about, but we feel it. With an evening game I think there is still enough time to prepare and get in the right mood. “For myself, I have developed a routine. I don’t feel the same level of excitement for every match. For me, this is impossible, and you should not expect it. “There is nothing wrong to feel sometimes a lower level of excitement, a lower level of tension. This is normal. This doesn’t mean we do it less seriously or prepare with less quality. I don’t want to get confused in this kind of thinking. “We can trust ourselves and prepare in the best way possible. We are asking what is it because it came out of the blue, it was a weird result given how the game went. It was different from the Real Madrid and Brentford performances.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(456, '/sport/football/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-everton-gary-neville-b2063677.html', 2, 'independent', 'Klopp warns rivals to control their aggression ahead of Everton clash', 'Jurgen Klopp has said that aggression in football is not displayed by kicking other players as he told opponents they cannot solve their problems by fouling. Liverpool host Everton on Sunday and while Klopp claimed he “didn’t think one second today” about the 2-2 draw in 2020 when Virgil van Dijk suffered cruciate ligament damage in an awful challenge by Jordan Pickford and Thiago Alcantara was left with a knee injury from a tackle by Richarlison, the German has been annoyed in the past by some challenges that have hurt his players in Merseyside derbies. And while he did not fault Manchester United’s Hannibal Mejbri for fouls on Jordan Henderson and Naby Keita in his brief cameo during Liverpool’s 4-0 win on Tuesday, he believes the former United captain Gary Neville was correct to retract his comment that he was “proud” of the teenager for his actions. “He had to apologise for that, rightly so,” said the Liverpool manager. “I understand where he is coming from, you want to see some aggression, but there is a difference between aggression and kicking players. That makes no sense. Aggression in football means you are ready to hurt yourself, not the other player. That is aggression in football. I don’t blame the kid, he came on late and the game was quick and obviously wanted to make an impression. He was a bit late here and a bit late there, all good.” Klopp called for a duty of care towards fellow players, adding: “Aggression in football is fine but you cannot sort your own problems by hurting the opposition players, that is what I have never understood. I played 325 professional football games and without aggression and physicality I would have played none. “It was my only strength that I had, so I am completely fine with that, but it’s about staying respectful, that’s all. Things can happen in football, it is a high-speed game, but not these kinds of things where you don’t care about the other [player]. He is a colleague who wants to play a few days later as well, that’s all.” Klopp said Hannibal Mejbri ‘wanted to make an impression’ following his late introduction at Anfield  Liverpool play a high-intensity game but invariably have one of the best disciplinary records in the Premier League, with the joint fewest red cards this season, just one, and the third lowest number of bookings, at 41. And Klopp added: “The pitch has a specific size, we both have 10 outfield players, you can close spaces by moving, you cannot close spaces by somebody down who cannot walk anymore. “We are ready for each kind of challenge but just keep it in a big frame of rules and stay there and everything will be fine.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

But Pogba’s return has not worked out how either party would want and the World Cup winner looks set to leave United this summer when his contract expires. There is little sign of him agreeing a new deal, meaning the 10 minutes he managed before limping off with a calf injury in Tuesday’s 4-0 meek loss at Liverpool are likely to be his last for the club. Rangnick says Pogba is facing a minimum of four weeks on the sidelines, which would bring an underwhelming period to a fitting conclusion. “It doesn’t make sense right now (to talk about his characterisation as a player),” the interim boss said when asked if the midfielder was an enigma. “He’s injured. He’s a player who won the World Cup with France. He’s such a good player that he was a regular starter for a team like France. “We all know what kind of potential he has and what kind of good player he can be. “But he was, quite like a few other players, just struggling to get his best performance sustainably on the pitch for a team like Manchester United. “This was not only the case this season or in the last couple of weeks, as far as I remember this was also the case in earlier years.” Asked why that was the case, Rangnick said: “Well, that’s difficult to say. If myself or other coaches knew that it would probably have been easier to change that. “I don’t know but right now it doesn’t make sense to think about that because he won’t be available for the game tomorrow and most likely not for the other four upcoming games. “As it seems right now, he will not renew his contract and, I don’t know, maybe the club or (incoming boss) Erik (Ten Hag) will also not want to renew the contract. I don’t know. “But it’s most likely that he won’t be here anymore next season.” Pogba is one of a number of players that are set to leave during a summer of change that will be overseen by newly-appointed manager Ten Hag. Edinson Cavani, Jesse Lingard and Juan Mata are others that are out of contract, while Nemanja Matic has already confirmed he is leaving. There are also a number of frustrated peripheral figures at the club, including Eric Bailly. The defender appears to be United’s fifth-choice centre-back and seemingly suggested on Instagram that he should play alongside Raphael Varane instead of Harry Maguire in Saturday’s Premier League match at Arsenal. “I’m not on Instagram and I’m not communicating on Instagram, not at all,” Rangnick said. “Listen, I’m not talking about my players now in the press conference not knowing what has happened. This doesn’t make sense. “But I can only tell you, never in my life and I will not be part of Instagram, Facebook or whatever. “If this is really true what you just told me, then I think it’s not the right sign. This should not happen in a football team, no matter in which league.” Ten Hag has his work cut out in the summer but United’s short-term focus is on trying to keep their Champions League hopes alive. Rangnick’s side desperately need a win at top-four rivals Arsenal and the interim boss says making amends for Tuesday’s 4-0 humbling at Liverpool is as important as impressing the new manager. “That should be the case but coming back to tomorrow’s game, we also owe that to our supporters,” he said. “We owe it to the couple of thousand supporters travelling to London tomorrow and the millions of Manchester United fans all over the world. We showed in the last couple of weeks and months that we’re capable of playing in a different way “And it’s also a question of pride and honour towards themselves. We cannot play the way we played at Liverpool. This is just impossible. “We showed in the last couple of weeks and months that we’re capable of playing in a different way. “Tomorrow it’s about just showing the basics, being compact, coming behind the ball, being able to attack, to sprint in the right moment, not as we did when we conceded the first goal. “It was never part of the game plan to stand at the halfway line, even more so since Paul Pogba was already hobbling across the pitch. “He should have laid down or sat down on the ground in that moment – I was watching that goal we conceded, obviously quite a few times – but he was trying to hobble behind the referee and telling him that he’s injured. “We were effectively one player down but still attacking high up and against a team like Liverpool, who is probably one of the best in the world in those transitional moments, that wasn’t particularly smart from our side. “Again, for tomorrow we just need to be – and we have shown that in quite a few away games – compact, close together, we need to be on the front foot whenever it is possible to put them under pressure and then create our own transitional moments. This is the basics of the game.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(458, '/sport/football/frank-lampard-everton-dominic-calvertlewin-premier-league-merseyside-b2063839.html', 2, 'independent', 'Everton cannot allow results elsewhere to influence them, Lampard says', 'Everton manager Frank Lampard insists they cannot allow themselves to be influenced by results around them. By the time they kick off at Anfield in the 240th Merseyside derby late on Sunday, the Toffees could be in the Premier League bottom three if Burnley succeed in getting at least a point at home to Wolves earlier in the day. However, while the Clarets remain their primary rivals in the race to avoid relegation, Lampard has not ruled out reeling in Leeds above them. Their fellow strugglers are only four points ahead, having played a match more than Everton, and the Blues boss believes if they edge closer to Jesse Marsch’s team, it will ramp up the pressure on them too. “We can’t gauge our mindset or attitude on other results. They will happen, you have to expect other teams will win games,” he said. “Until you are mathematically out of it, you are in a battle.” Lampard knows his side make the short trip across Stanley Park with expectations on them low, having taken just six points away from home all season. Even the victory at Anfield last year – their first since 1999 – against an injury-ravaged, out-of-form Liverpool team was regarded as against the odds so the Everton manager has no problems embracing the fact no one really gives them a chance. “There’s no problem being an underdog, we are the underdogs, it’s clear because of where Liverpool are in the process,” he added. “But where we are, we have to fight to the last minute, no matter what happens in this game.” Everton’s chances have not been helped by the absence of striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin, whose injury-plagued season continues with a thigh problem keeping him out. The England international has made just 14 appearances this season and the team have struggled for goals without him but Lampard does not believe there is anything more serious wrong with the forward. “I think every player has a potential underlying problem. Nobody’s a machine, this is a tough industry and there’s a lot of demands on the players,” he said. “There’s obviously an element of bad luck where it happens to players, they have a run of bad luck and we know that one injury leads to another. “Nobody is infallible in those terms. Dominic is like every other player, he’s had a bad run.” Richarlison has been required to fill the central role but it does not play to his strengths and the impact substitution of Salomon Rondon to help secure a late draw against Leicester on Wednesday may give Lampard something to think about. “He showed an ability to hold the ball up and be involved in the goal and I knew he has that,” said the manager. “He is a smart player, good player with a great work ethic. It is a great option. “With Richy (Richarlison), if you look at the modern-day number nine, it is different to years ago. Dominic maybe is nearer to that old one. “Richarlison can do that role for us but he can also work off the left, as an inside-left as much as a wide man. It is a real beauty to have players across the front line who can be versatile.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

O2, EE, Vodafone and Three ranked lower on customer service and value for money than lesser-known rivals, according to a survey of phone users. This is despite virtual networks using the same phone masts and other infrastructure as the so-called Big Four, rather than running their own services. Three scored the lowest of the Big Four and received the lowest rating out of any network for reliability while nearly half (45 per cent) of its users experienced problems in the past year compared to three in 10 (29 per cent) across all mobile network customers surveyed. The Big Four provide more than 75 per cent of UK mobile phone users  Virtual network Smarty uses the same infrastructure as Three but came first place in the table with five out of five stars for value for money. The largest UK network, EE, came 11th out of the 16 providers analysed with users reporting mediocre customer service, technical support and value for money. The network\'s download speeds was the only category to gain a four star rating. The Big Four providers currently service three quarters (76 per cent) of customers in the UK, according to Ofcom. But consumer champions Which? say the flexibility offered by virtual networks keeps mobile costs down and could better support consumers facing a household budget squeeze. It found customers pay on average almost £10 a month less than Big Four customers across all contract types. Natalie Hitchins at Which? said: “The vast majority of mobile users are with one of the Big Four providers, but our research suggests consumers could save money during the cost-of-living crisis and get better service by switching to one of the networks challenging their dominance. \"Anyone looking for a reliable carrier that offers a flexible contract and good value for money should consider one of the virtual networks, who continue to outperform the Big Four year after year.\" Three scored the lowest of the Big Four and received the lowest rating out of any network for reliability Which? said customers of the Big Four experienced price hikes of up to 11 per cent but remained the most loyal, with more than half of EE, O2 and Vodafone users being with the provider for more than five years. Experts warn these longer-staying customers are likely to be paying more than they need to for their phone contract. Which? suggests challenger providers have an edge over bigger players by focusing on rolling monthly sim deals over phones with lengthy contracts. An EE spokesperson said: “EE customers enjoy being part of the UK\'s biggest and fastest network with more 5G coverage than any other provider and EE has been named the UK\'s best network for the past eight years by RootMetrics. “We provide the best customer service across the industry reflected in the most recent Ofcom complaints data”.

(471, '/news/science/world-french-geneva-swiss-cern-b2063298.html', 7, 'independent', 'World’s most powerful particle accelerator comes back to life', 'The world’s most powerful particle accelerator – the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) – has sprung back to life after a three-year shutdown. After planned maintenance and upgrades, it has been turned back on and will shortly start another run of cutting-edge physics experiments. The LHC, at Cern, on the French/Swiss border near Geneva, was switched off in 2018 to let scientists and engineers from around the world make it even more powerful. On Friday, particles were pushed through the collider’s almost 17-mile ring for the first time since December 2018. However, it will take six to eight weeks for the LHC to get up to full speed, at which point proton collisions can take place again. Head of Cern’s Beams department, Rhodri Jones, said: “These beams circulated at injection energy and contained a relatively small number of protons. “High-intensity, high-energy collisions are a couple of months away. “But first beams represent the successful restart of the accelerator after all the hard work of the long shutdown.” As part of the international effort, UK teams have been involved in helping to improve the performance of each of the LHC’s four main instruments. The UK’s contributions to the upgrade are worth more than £25 million, funded by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC). Executive chairman of STFC and particle physicist, Professor Mark Thomson, said: “The UK continues to enjoy a strong and fruitful relationship with Cern. “Our scientists and engineers have played pivotal roles in contributing to the major upgrades, paving the way for exciting UK-led research on the more powerful beams at the LHC. “It will never cease to impress me how our scientists and engineers, with their incredible skill and expertise, can continue to improve these cutting-edge facilities using ever-more innovative technologies. “The global science community will now eagerly await the results from the new run, which will probe some of the recent hints of new physics seen at the LHC and elsewhere.” While pilot beams circulated in the LHC for a short time in October 2021, the beams that circulated on Friday mark not only the end of the second long shutdown for the LHC, but also the beginning of preparations for four years of physics data taking, which is expected to start this summer. This third run of the LHC, called Run 3, will see the machine’s experiments collecting data from collisions not only at a record energy but also in unparalleled numbers. The Atlas and CMS experiments can each expect to receive more collisions during this physics run than in the two previous physics runs combined, while LHCb, which underwent a complete revamp during the shutdown, can hope to see its collision count increase by a factor of three. Meanwhile, thanks to a major upgrade, Alice – a specialised detector for studying heavy-ion collisions – can expect a 50 times increase in the total number of recorded ion collisions. The unprecedented number of collisions will allow international teams of physicists at Cern and across the world to study the Higgs boson in great detail and put the standard model of particle physics and its various extensions to the most stringent tests yet.

The celestial display is expected to peak in the early hours of April 23 and will be visible all across the sky. Meteor showers, or shooting stars, are caused when pieces of debris known as meteorites enter Earth’s atmosphere at speeds of around 43 miles per second, burning up and causing streaks of light. The Lyrid shower takes its name from the constellation of Lyra, where the shooting stars appear to originate from. These meteors are pieces of debris falling from the Thatcher Comet, which is expected to return to the inner solar system in 2276, after an orbital period of 415 years. As with all meteor showers, in order to see the Lyrids it is necessary to find a dark site with an unobstructed view of the sky. The number of meteors people could see will depend on a variety of things, from the time of night to the level of background light. A bright sky will drown out the fainter ones making them much more difficult to see. However, this year the Lyrids started on April 14, two days before a full Moon, and come to a peak on 22-23 April, two days before the last quarter Moon, so conditions are unfavourable. Jacob Foster, astronomer from the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said: “The Lyrid meteor shower is one of the major meteor showers of the year. “The meteors will spread out across the sky, so simply facing to the north-east on the night of the 22nd should be enough to see a few for yourself. “Make sure you have an unobstructed view of the sky to maximise your chances of spotting them. “At their peak, we can expect to see up to 18 shooting stars per hour. “You won’t need any kind of specialist viewing equipment, just clear skies and warm clothes.” And if stargazers miss the display, or simply have not had enough of exploring the sky, there will still be plenty to look out for as Jupiter, Venus, Mars, Saturn and the Moon line up along the horizon on Sunday. The best viewing window is between around 5am and 6am (BST), just after the planets rise above the horizon, but just before the Sun follows them. Despite appearing from Earth to be lined up, these types of alignments – sometimes known as planetary parades – occur only from our perspective here on the Earth, and are not actually lined up in space. The planets will be visible with the naked eye, and no specialist equipment is necessary.

(473, '/news/science/malaria-vaccine-africa-cases-oxford-latest-b2062711.html', 7, 'independent', '‘More funding needed’ for rollout of highly effective malaria vaccine', 'More government funding is needed to faciliate the rollout of the world’s most effective malaria vaccine in Africa, the Oxford professor who developed the jab has warned. It was announced in April 2021 that the vaccine was 77 per cent effective in protecting against the mosquito-borne disease - the first time that a malaria jab has surpassed the 75 per cent efficacy goal set by the World Health Organisation. After more than a century of trying, the development of a highly protective vaccine was lauded as a major scientific breakthrough for humanity - but Professor Adrian Hill, who designed the jab at Oxford University’s Jenner institute, said it was unlikely that a mass rollout would begin until next year. Prof Hill called on the UK government to increase its funding for tackling malaria in Africa, arguing that the world now has the resources and technology it needs to eradicate the disease by the end of the next decade. “Money will be required to fund the provision of doses and a new immunisation campaign for the malaria vaccine,” Prof Hill told reporters during a media briefing on Thursday. “It seems extraordinary after the worst pandemic we’ve had in a century, where vaccines have played a very major role in getting us out of the pandemic, that we can’t find the money to get Africa out of the horrendous mortality that it’s been suffering for decades and decades, if not hundreds of years, from malaria.” Oxford’s malaria vaccine is still being trialled among thousands of infants in Western and Eastern Africa. This will confirm the safety of the vaccine, though Prof Hill told The Independent last year that “it’s hard to imagine that efficacy would be hugely different” from what has already been seen. Speaking on Thursday, Prof Hill said the world has “gone backwards in the last couple of years” as a result of disruption from Covid-19. There were an estimated 241 million cases and 627,000 malaria deaths worldwide in 2020, according to the World Health Organisation. This represents about 14 million more cases in 2020 compared to 2019, and 69, 000 more deaths. Approximately two-thirds of these additional deaths were linked to disruptions in the provision of malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment during the pandemic, the WHO said. The Global Fund estimates that to reverse these trends, worldwide funding for malaria - alongside HIV and tuberculous - will need to increase by 30 per cent, to £13.8 billion, for the next three years. To help sustain this increase, the British government needs to raise its own contributions to the Global Fund from £1.46 billion, which covered 2020 to 2022, to £1.8 billion, according to Malaria No More UK. Prof Hill said it would be possible to “knock down [malaria] deaths” within the next decade by “maybe 75 per cent, maybe even 90 per cent,” if all relevant tools can be deployed effectively in Africa. This means making the Oxford vaccine widely available to those who need it, he added. Once deaths are reduced “substantially,” it could be possible to eradicate malaria by 2040, Prof Hill said. “As with polio, once you do that, you get your money back, you stop spending billions a year on controlling malaria if you can eliminate it,” he added. “It’s a choice for society, for governments. Are we serious about this? We know that far more people died from malaria than from Covid in 2020 in Africa, very likely in 2021 as well. This is a value judgement. Are we going to provide this money to to control a disease that is now controllable because new tools are becoming available?” Scientists have been trying to produce an effective vaccine against malaria, caused by the Plasmodium parasite, since 1907. Due to the size of the malaria parasite, which is much bigger than a virus, finding the right protein in its genome to target and neutralise is remarkably difficult, making both natural and artificially induced immunity hard to achieve. GlaxoSmithKline’s vaccine has already been recommended for use in sub-Saharan Africa by the WHO. The findings of a pilot programme run in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi showed the vaccine led to a 30 per cent reduction in severe malaria among young children. Separate research from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine has shown the jab can be up to 70 per cent efficacious as part of a seasonal prevention approach. To date, more than 1 million children have now received one or more doses of the GSK vaccine. Prof Hill said it was unlikely the Oxford malaria vaccine would be rolled out on a mass scale until next year. The quicker more funding arrives, the quicker the immunisation programme can start, he said. “What strikes me as somebody who’s worked on malaria for a very long time, is that when Covid appeared, money appeared out of the system,” Prof Hill said. “It’s only when it really hits home to countries around the world, all around. that money is extracted from the system. “Now that we have the technologies obviously developed in Africa … why waste all that investment of time and delay another five to 10 years till we feel comfortable about our personal budgets again. “I think the money is in the system. We’re not talking about tens or hundreds of billions of dollars which were required for the Covid response. We’re talking about hundreds of millions. It’s money that that is there.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(474, '/news/world/americas/powassan-virus-death-maine-usa-b2062735.html', 7, 'independent', 'Maine man dies from rare tick-borne virus', 'A man in Maine died after becoming infected with a rare virus he contracted from a tick bite, the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported. On Wednesday, Maine’s CDC reported the death of the adult-aged man from Waldo County, an area that’s located about 30 miles southwest of Bangor, who the agency said died from Powassan virus, a rare pathogen that the US has only recorded about 25 cases of per year since 2015. Powassan virus is transmitted to humans when an infected deer tick, groundhog tick or squirrel tick bites a person and passes it onto them. Symptoms for the viral infection typically set in within a week to a month after the initial bite from one of the infected bloodsuckers, but the CDC warns that many people with Powassan virus wouldn’t even realise it as most who become infected won’t experience symptoms. For the man who died in Maine, the infectious disease agency reported that he died while in hospital after developing neurological symptoms, which the agency noted can occur in 10 per cent of people who contract severe disease from the infection. Some of the people who become infected with this severe disease, they said, can develop a brain infection, known as encephalitis, or in the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord, meningitis. Symptoms that the CDC says that people should be on the lookout for if they’ve been bitten by a tick and suspect they may have contracted Powassan virus include fever, headache, vomiting and weakness, or if they suspect they’ve potentially developed one of the more severe diseases (encephalitis or meningitis) they should monitor for confusion, difficulty speaking, seizures and loss of coordination. There is no specific treatment for Powassan virus, but the CDC advises the first step to treat the rare virus is to prevent a bite from a potentially infected tick from happening in the first place. “Ticks are active and looking for a host to bite right now,” Nirav D Shah, director of the Maine CDC, said in a statement. “I urge Maine people and visitors to take steps that prevent tick bites.” Though it’s an uncommon virus to contract, before 2015 its presence was even more scarce as the country had only recorded 10 cases per year between 2011 and 2014. In Maine alone, the state has just reported a total of 14 cases since 2010. Part of what could be driving the rates of the virus up in recent years is the expansion of its host, deer ticks (also known as black-legged ticks), throughout the United States. Though they’re more commonly feared for carrying the bacteria that causes the severely debilitating Lyme disease, black-legged ticks can also pass on the pathogen that causes Powassan virus and the critter has been increasingly creeping its way across the country. Experts acknowledge that the reasoning behind the tick-boom in recent years, which covers a variety of species, not just the black-legged ones, can be explained by theories as varied as the terrain the critters now inhabit across the continental US. But for deer ticks, recent research posits that a warming planet has facilitated the migration of the bloodsuckers further north and with shorter winters has even provided a longer season for the critters to bite human hosts. Another explanation for the increased presence of these ticks suggests that a loss of biodiversity in recent years is to blame. A loss of biodiversity rarely upsets “generalist” species, such as white-tailed deer, who happen to be some of the bug’s main feasting options. While other species may dwindle, the white-tailed deer, who has a varied diet and few natural predators in the US, thrives. And with a greater number of hosts to feast on, combined with a longer period of time to graze due to shortened and less abrasive winters, the black-legged tick population begins to climb. The CDC again recommends the best advice to prevent any unwanted disease or virus contraction from a tick is to prevent the bite in the first place. They’re top tips include wearing bug repellant, having a friend or family member check you over when you come in from a wooded area, wearing long sleeves and pants tucked into your socks and tossing your clothes in the dryer for 10 minutes when you come in from a place known to have an active tick population.

(475, '/climate-change/news/ravens-crows-intelligence-adaptation-evolution-b2062689.html', 7, 'independent', '‘Brains and brawn’ allow crows and ravens to thrive almost anywhere', 'Crows and ravens owe their world-dominating success to both their body shapes and their proportionately large brains, new research suggests. The two species undertook a rapid expansion across the planet during their evolution, during which time they left other members of their group, the corvidae, including jays, magpies and jackdaws, behind. As a result, they are now present around the world, from the Arctic to Australia, Indonesia to Africa, with the only large areas they don’t call home being South America and Antarctica. While they have long been recognised as intelligent birds that use tools, solve complex abstract problems and even speak a volume of words, it is less well appreciated how diverse they are. New research by academics at Washington University in St Louis has helped uncover the secret behind these amazing birds’ planetary expansion. The work highlights two key factors: Crows and ravens’ great flying ability, which allows them to gain access to new places more easily than other birds, and how their big bodies and big brains played an important role in helping them adapt and survive in the new climates they occupied. “When we think about processes of global diversification, it is important to consider not just the ability to reach new places, but also the ability to survive once you get there,\" said Carlos Botero, assistant professor of biology in arts and sciences at Washington University. \"Our work suggests that crows and the ravens diversified both quickly and widely because they were particularly good at coping with different habitats.” The authors said the birds’ incredible ability to rapidly expand and diversify across the planet was driven by a specific combination of traits. Using specimens housed in museums across Europe and the US, the scientists found that they have longer wing lengths, bigger body sizes and bigger relative brain sizes compared with other corvids. The study’s first-author Joan Garcia-Porta, a postdoctoral research associate at Washington University and now a fellow at the University of Barcelona, said: “We hypothesise that these three very convenient combinations of traits are what allowed this group of birds to colonise and diversify across the world.\" Longer wings means higher flying capacities that allowed the birds to disperse across the world. Big brains relative to their bodies suggest that ancestral crows and ravens were behaviorally flexible, the study said. \"They were smarter than other corvids and, therefore, able to figure out how to live in a new environment, increasing their chances of survival,\" the research team said. Their larger body sizes also gave them a competitive advantage over smaller species, helping them to flourish in new places. “We are excited with these new insights on how these birds were able to do things that even close relatives did not,” Dr Botero said. “It truly seems that their incredible behavioural flexibility may have played a major role in allowing these birds to survive initial periods of maladaptation and hang in there long enough for selection to catch up and produce a range of new species in the process.” The result of their readiness to adapt means that crows and ravens experienced high rates of trait evolution and speciation as they moved into the many different environments they encountered during their rapid expansion across the planet. Arriving in new environments exposed them to new selective pressures – their ability to thrive in the cold Arctic after moving from a tropical rainforest, for example, likely required very different strategies and traits. “These new environments often favour tweaks to an organism’s phenotype that facilitate survival and overall performance,\" said Dr Botero. \"That process is often known as optimising selection,” he said, adding that this is often of critical importance in creating new species. For crows and ravens, these tweaks meant acquiring new beak shapes that did not exist in any other corvids, thereby increasing beak shape variation in the corvidae family. The scientists also found that they increased body size variation as they colonised new environments. Dr Garcia-Porta said: “Thanks to these amazing birds, we now understand a bit more the processes by which animals rapidly expand across the planet and how this geographic expansion translates to the production of new species with new morphologies.” The research is published in the journal Nature Communications.

(476, '/tech/sapphire-fibre-sensor-plane-space-fusion-power-b2062496.html', 7, 'independent', '‘Sapphire fibre’ could transform planes and help bring fusion power', 'A new sensor made of “sapphire fibre” could transform planes and help with technologies such as fusion power, scientists say. The sensor can withstand extreme temperatures, still working when subjected to conditions over 2000C, the researchers behind it say. That could allow it to be run through a jet engine, for instance, with the data being used to adapt how engines work and significantly reduce emissions. Because it can withstand radiation, too, the sapphire fibre could be used in space and fusion power, the scientists say. ‘These sapphire optical fibres will have many different potential applications within the extreme environments of a fusion energy powerplant,” said Rob Skilton, head of research at Remote Applications in Challenging Environments part of UK Atomic Energy Authority. “This technology has the potential to significantly increase the capabilities of future sensor and robotic maintenance systems in this sector, helping UKAEA in its mission to deliver safe, sustainable, low carbon fusion power to the grid.” The new fibre is made out of industrially grown sapphire and is just half a millimetre thick. If light is sent into one end of it, it is reflected back from a point along it – and the colour of that light can then be used to measure the temperature at that point. Existing such sensors have run into problems for decades because the fibre is vast compared to the wavelength of light, even if it looks small. As such, the light can travel through the fibre in different routes, reflecting back different wavelengths at once. The new breakthrough involved making a channel along the fibre. That means that the light only travels through a tiny cross-section, about one-hundredth of a milimetre wide. That means that the sensor reflects primarily just one single wavelength of light, making it much more useful. An article describing the finding, ‘Single-mode sapphire fiber Bragg grating’, is published in the journal Optics Express. It was carried out by the University of Oxford, in collaboration with a number of companies and the UK Atomic Energy Authority.

(477, '/voices/vinyl-record-store-day-music-nostalgia-b2063864.html', 7, 'independent', 'Vinyl is important to young people – it’s not about being ‘on trend’', 'I grew up listening to music in the age of CDs, MP3s and streaming – it all seemed to change so quickly. Vinyl wasn’t something I ever really thought about, and nostalgia, to me, was keeping hold of my iPod when I could just as easily stream everything on my iPhone. Music has always played a hugely important part in my life, particularly during those angsty teenage years when it felt as though everything was awful and nothing was awful all at the same time. Living in Bradford during the 2001 riots, I was acutely aware of the hatred political groups such as the British National Party (BNP) and the English Defence League (EDL) were spewing out onto the streets – literally. It was normal to see the BNP driving down our street and shouting at us to vote for them. There was a lot of political tension and I remember thinking how terrible it would be for some of my friends, particularly those whose very existence these hate groups were targeting. Aged about 12 or 13, I went to my very first gig. It was at Bingley Live Music Festival and I saw Scroobius Pip who was talking about the BNP and it felt good to hear that this hatred, that almost felt normalised, was being challenged by someone. From then on, I went on to see tons of live music with friends and family, and I developed a taste for punk. The most pivotal moment, perhaps, was going to a punk gig and hearing all these people chanting “f*** the EDL”. It felt like a real connection, a moment of coming together. Yes, we were all angry, but we weren’t angry at the person next to us, or at our neighbours or the people who had arrived on our shores in a tiny boat. We were angry with the politicians and the hate groups who were creating the situation and the divide. As I got older, I learnt to play bass and formed a band with some friends. We rehearsed almost every day but we could only actually play two songs over and over. But I listened to more and more music – developing a love of ska punk and rock music. Growing up when I did, we always had music at our fingertips, and we could stream it the second a new song or album was released. But when I was about 19, the vinyl revival hit, and it became a bit of a “hipster” thing to buy vinyl and walk around with one of those little Dansette record players. So, yes, when I first started taking notice of vinyl, it was the “on-trend” thing to do. I bought a few records because it was cool, but I soon developed an interest in how vinyl could change the way we listen to music. Today, I have a small but growing collection of vinyl. I certainly don’t buy everything on vinyl – the cost means I have to have a very good reason to invest in it. With older music, albums that weren’t built for streaming, I enjoy listening on vinyl. It gives me more of a feeling of being able to hear it as it was meant to be heard – or at least of hearing it how everyone else did when it first came out. There are certain bands that I buy on vinyl just because their sound is really suited to it. The Cure are a band I always like to listen to on vinyl because they just sound so good when played that way. Vinyl is something I might buy when I am keen to listen to a whole album. There are times when I just like the odd song and that’s fine, but when I really appreciate a whole album and can see myself proactively listening to it, rather than passively having it on in the background – like when I’m sitting in the living room or mooching around the house – that’s when I want to have it on vinyl. Being a fan also plays a part. I absolutely love Florence and the Machine, so as a fan, I like to have a physical copy of their music. It makes me feel like a bigger supporter of their work and more connected to it. To keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment, sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter by clicking here Vinyl is lovely to receive as a gift – you can’t get excited about someone buying you a couple of download credits in the same way. My friends recently bought me Bo Burnham’s Inside album which I loved getting because we followed his lockdown comedy on Netflix. And even though we can listen to music online, you can still get the vinyl envy – I know I really want to get my hands on my dad’s old Meatloaf records. And my housemate, Cameron, was given a vinyl copy of Dolly Parton Live From Glastonbury in 2014 which I am insanely jealous of because I watched that gig and it’s probably my favourite live performance of all time. So it’s not about having vinyl for vinyl’s sake. And it’s not just something that older generations like to have for nostalgia reasons. If younger people wanted to buy vinyl just because it was “the thing to do”, it wouldn’t matter what we bought or how we listened to it. For me, vinyl is a part of my journey into music and my love of music, and it gives me something that streaming doesn’t. But if that’s considered “cool” then great, so be it.

(478, '/news/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-latest-putin-mariupol-b2063791.html', 7, 'independent', 'Russia attacks Mariupol steel plant with hundreds of civilians trapped inside', 'Russian troops stand in front of the destroyed administration building of Azovstal Iron and Steel Works  Russian forces are attacking a steel plant that is the last Ukrainian stronghold in the city of Mariupol, a Ukrainian official said.  Oleksiy Arestovich, an advisor to the head of Ukraine’s presidential office, said during a briefing on Saturday that the Russian forces have resumed air strikes on Azovstal factory and were trying to storm it. “The enemy is trying to completely suppress resistance of the defenders of Mariupol in the area of Azovstal,” Mr Arestovich said. On Thursday, Mr Putin ordered the Russian military to not storm the plant after his defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, reported that the whole of Mariupol, with the exception of Azovstal, had been “liberated” by the Russians.  Instead, the Russian president called for a blockade of the area in an attempt to stifle the remaining pocket of resistance there. Ukrainian officials have estimated that about 2,000 of their troops are inside the plant along with about 1,000 civilians – including women and children – sheltering in the facility’s underground tunnels which spread over four square miles.  Mr Arestovich says the Ukrainian fighters are still holding on despite the resumed attacks and are even trying to counter them. Earlier today, the Azov Regiment of Ukraine’s National Guard, which has members trapped inside the Azovstal factory, released footage of around two dozen women and children, some of whom have been in the underground tunnels for two months.  The footage of Azovstal showed soldiers giving sweets to children who respond with fist-bumps. One young girl says she and her relatives “haven’t seen neither the sky, nor the sun” since they left home on 27 February. “We want to see peaceful skies, we want to breathe in fresh air,” one woman in the video said. “You have simply no idea what it means for us to simply eat, drink some sweetened tea. For us, it is already happiness.”  The regiment’s deputy commander, Sviatoslav Palamar, told The Associated Press the video was shot Thursday, the same day Russia declared victory over the rest of Mariupol. The contents could not be independently verified. Russian forces are attacking a steel plant that is the last Ukrainian stronghold in the city of Mariupol, a Ukrainian official said Fiona Hill, a British-born Russia expert and former White House intelligence adviser, said Vladimir Putin’s “nuclear blackmail” during the conflict in Ukraine was likely to increase the international demand for nuclear arms. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the former deputy assistant to the president when Donald Trump was in office said: “The nuclear issue is something that everybody should be concerned about on a global basis because he [Mr Putin] is basically telling every country: You need a nuclear weapon. “So the whole idea of non-proliferation is basically out the window because it is basically very clear that the reason we are not going after Russia with everything that we’ve got is because they’ve got a nuclear weapon and he is saying he’s prepared to use one. “And everyone is looking at this now and thinking, ‘Right, well if I want to have my way with my neighbour, I need a nuclear weapon’ – that’s basically what Putin is telling us. “And conversely, everyone is thinking, ‘If I’m going to have a good defensive posture, I can’t rely on someone else coming to my assistance, I need a nuclear weapon’. “So we are in a whole new territory that we haven’t even been in during the Cold War, and so this requires really robust diplomacy.” She continued: “If you’re Japan and South Korea, for example, you’re really rethinking your non-nuclear posture and your reliance on the United States. Putin has put everything in jeopardy.” Russia will deploy its first military unit armed with nuclear-capable ballistic Sarmat missiles this year, the head of the country’s space agency has said.  Dmitry Rogozin, who runs the Roscosmos agency, said the until will be based in Uzhur, just under 2,000 miles from Moscow, according to the Tasss news agency.

Speaking on television, Serhiy Haidai confirmed that some Ukrainian forces were leaving settlements to regroup, adding that this was not a critical setback. Russia continues to deny targeting civilians in its war in Ukraine, despite evidence to the contrary. Russian troops downed a Ukrainian Su-25 fighter jet and destroyed three MI-8 helicopters at an airbase in the Kharkiv region, the Kremlin has claimed. Ukraine is yet to respond to the Russian reports.  The Ukrainian army estimates that 21,600 Russian soldiers have been killed since Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine on 24 February.  In total, 854 Russian tanks and 177 Russian planes have been destroyed, it claimed.  Here are the latest Ukrainian estimates:  Evacuations from the besieged city of Mariupol were due to start at midday local time (9am GMT), the Ukrainian deputy prime minister has indicated. “Today, we again will be trying to evacuate women, children and the elderly,” Iryna Vereshchuk said in an online post.

(479, '/news/uk/politics/ukraine-russia-tanks-security-embassy-b2063324.html', 7, 'independent', 'UK offers to send tanks to Poland in bid to help Ukraine', 'Britain could send tanks to Poland so that Warsaw can supply Ukraine with its own Soviet-era armoured vehicles, Boris Johnson said on Friday as a Russian general said Moscow wanted full control of southern Ukraine. The prime minister set out plans for a new long-term “security guarantee” for Ukraine after the end of the war, which would stop short of Nato membership, but be tough enough to deter Moscow from a repeat invasion. The guarantee would “make sure their territory is so fortified as to be impregnable”, said the PM. But it would not replicate Nato’s Article 5 principle, that an attack on one member is an attack on all, depriving Kyiv of the shield of Western military engagement in the event of any future assault. Rustam Minnekayev, a Russian commander, was quoted by state media on Friday as saying full control over southern Ukraine would give it access to a breakaway Russian-occupied part of Moldova in the west. That would cut off Ukraine\'s entire coastline and mean pushing hundreds of miles west beyond current lines, past the major Ukrainian cities of Mykolaiv and Odesa. It also goes well beyond the supposed focus on securing only eastern areas such as the Donbas. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to comment. As the focus of the war moves away from Kyiv, Mr Johnson also said that the UK will next week reopen its embassy in the capital in a gesture of support for the Ukrainian people. But he accepted the gloomy recent assessment of Western defence officials that the war could drag on until the end of 2023 and end with Putin able to claim some sort of victory. Sending Challenger 2 tanks to Poland to “backfill” for T-72s supplied to the Ukrainians would come close to crossing the line that Mr Johnson has so far carefully observed, of providing only defensive kit in order to avoid being accused of provoking Moscow. No request has yet been received from Warsaw, but it is understood that delivery could be arranged within days if needed. Observers suggested that the bold proposal appeared to be an attempt by the PM to distract attention away from his travails over Downing Street parties, which have overshadowed his two-day trip to India. In talks with prime minister Narendra Modi in Delhi, Mr Johnson made no attempt to persuade the Indian premier to condemn Putin, in what was seen as an effort to avoid jeopardising a planned free trade agreement, which he said he wanted “done by Divali” in October. Indian foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said later that Johnson had put “no pressure” on Modi to ditch his neutral stance on the war, which has seen India abstain in key votes censuring Russia at the United Nations. But Mr Johnson told a press conference at the conclusion of the visit that Modi assured him that he had asked Putin several times in private conversations “what on Earth he thinks he’s doing and where he thinks this is going”. Glossing over the deep differences on Ukraine between London and Delhi – which is calling for a ceasefire and diplomatic dialogue – Mr Johnson said: “What the Indians want is peace and they want the Russians out, and I totally agree with that.” Appearing alongside Modi earlier, the PM avoiding ruffling his hosts’ feathers by making no mention of Russia or Ukraine at all in a seven-minute statement, saying only that “autocratic coercion” around the world made it important for democracies to work closely together. He sealed a “new and expanded” defence and security partnership, which will ease UK arms exports to India and provide UK expertise for the development of Indian-built fighter jets. But he acknowledged concerns raised by defence think tank Rusi that Western components – including some made in the UK – were being used in Russian weapons after being laundered through countries like India, telling reporters that Britain needs to “take steps to make sure this stuff doesn’t go through other routes to Russia”. Mr Johnson, who has previously insisted that the Russian president “must fail” in his military adventure, agreed that a lengthy war ending with Putin claiming victory at least in the south and east of Ukraine was now a “realistic possibility”. Mr Johnson said: “Putin has a huge army. He has a very difficult political position because he’s made a catastrophic blunder. “The only option he now has, really, is to continue to try to use his appalling, grinding approach driven by artillery, trying to grind the Ukrainians down. “No matter what military superiority Vladimir Putin may be able to bring to bear in the next few months – I agree, it may be a long period – he will not be able to conquer the spirit of the Ukrainian people. That is an observable fact. “On the contrary, what he is doing is reinforcing that will to resist in the people of Ukraine.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(480, '/news/world/europe/vladimir-putin-health-holding-table-russia-b2063102.html', 7, 'independent', 'Video shows ‘bloated and slouching’ Putin gripping table during meeting', 'Vladimir Putin’s health has been called into question again after a video showed him tightly clutching a table throughout a meeting with Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu. The clip has sparked fresh theories about his health, which has reportedly deteriorated since he launched Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. In the footage posted online by the Kremlin, the 69-year-old Russian president grabs hold of the corner of the table with his right hand as soon as he sits down for the meeting, and keeps hold of it for the entirety of the 12 minute clip. Mr Putin can also be seen intermittently holding the edge of the table with his left hand while Mr Shoigu reads him a statement about Mariupol – where up to 120,000 people have been unable to flee and Russia announced on Thursday it would blockade the Azovstal steel plant that is the last foothold of the Ukrainains in the besieged city. The Russian president said he wished to congratulate his troops for having “liberated” the Black Sea port city in southern Ukraine – which has seen some of the worst attacks and bloodshed during the invasion. The US State Department said Mr Putin’s claim to have liberated the city was “yet more disinformation from (a) well-worn playbook”. The footage shows Mr Putin’s right thumb constantly moving as he listens to his defence minister, and it has been suggested that the fidgeting could indicate that he was trying to hide a tremor typical of Parkinson’s disease. Sir Richard Dearlove – former MI6 head – and Professor Gwythian Prins – previously a Nato adviser – have claimed that Mr Putin has shown signs of the progressive nervous system disorder. In the clip, Mr Putin moves his feet up and down, appears restless and tense, and clears his throat a number of times while listening to his defence minister – who reportedly suffered a heart attack recently at the age of 66. The Russian president also sits slightly hunched, with his spine pressed flat against the back of the chair, in contrast to Shoigu who appears to be sitting more upright and without the need for any support.  Anders Aslund, an author and former adviser on Russia and Ukraine, said that both men looked like they were not in good health. “Shoigu has to read his comments to Putin and slurs badly, suggesting that the rumors of his heart attack are likely. He sits badly. Poor performance. Worth watching,” he said. The meeting with Mr Shoigu is not the first time Mr Putin has been spotted gripping a table during a meeting. Also on Thursday, he was snapped holding the corner of a table during a meeting with Nikolay Tokarev, the president of Transneft, a Russian state-controlled oil pipeline company. Mr Putin was visited by a thyroid cancer specialist 35 times, and an ears, nose, and throat specialist 59 times between 2016 and 2020, according to Russian investigative news outlet Proekt.  The Kremlin leader’s bloated appearance has led to Fiona Hill, a US expert on Russia, to tell Politico in February that Mr Putin may be taking high doses of steroids for back pain he has suffered since falling off a horse in 2012 – or “there may be something else,” she added. Moscow has repeatedly denied reports that Mr Putin has suffered from severe ill health.  Earlier this month, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied that Mr Putin had undergone surgery for thyroid cancer, and said that the president’s health was “excellent” and that he had not dealt with any illness more serious than a cold.

Rylov, who won gold in 100m and 200m backstroke events at last year’s Tokyo Olympics, was among several athletes who attended a massive rally at Moscow’s Luzhniki stadium last month hosted by President Vladimir Putin. Rylov and other athletes wore the letter “Z” on their outfit, an identifying symbol used by supporters of what Russia calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine. FINA said the suspension came “following Mr. Rylov’s attendance and conduct at an event held at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow”. There was no immediate reaction from Rylov, who also lost his sponsorship deal with swimwear maker Speedo over his presence at the rally. FINA has already cancelled all its events that were set to take place in Russia and has barred Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials from taking part in its competitions until the end of the year.

(482, '/news/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-refugees-punk-rocker-poodle-b2063212.html', 7, 'independent', '‘Punk rocker’ poodle puts smiles on faces of Ukrainian refugees', 'A toy poodle with a pink mohawk, described as a ‘punk rocker’ by her owner, has been putting smiles on the faces of young Ukrainian refugees in Poland. Eight-year-old Juno belongs to Lars Whelan, a volunteer at Warsaw Central railway station. The former ship’s captain, 48, from the US, said Juno has been to more than 30 countries but has never been in a situation like the one in Poland right now. But she has quickly become a favourite among refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine since she arrived with Mr Whelan in early April. He told the PA news agency: “She’ll sit there and let a little kid hold her and pet her. It really makes a big difference to them. “There’s a lot of kids that (have) been travelling for two days, they don’t know where they’re going. They don’t know where they are. “They don’t know what anyone’s saying because they speak Ukrainian and people are speaking Polish or whatever. “And they’re kind of zombified. You know, they have a blank expression on their face. “Juno’s really good at lighting these kids up and getting them to smile and have a little bit of gleam in their eyes.” Mr Whelan, who grew up in Boston but now lives in Hollywood, has travelled the world with Juno, including a tour of the UK. The pair headed to Poland to help refugees leaving Ukraine, with the option of dropping Juno off with friends in Europe if she was unhappy about being in the thick of it. But any concerns were quickly dismissed and Juno is enjoying her role alongside Mr Whelan, who is a co-ordinator and supervisor at the station. Mr Whelan said: “I was on the phone all day (on Wednesday) morning and she got annoyed and started pawing my face. “I’m like ‘what do you want?’ It wasn’t water… she wanted to go see the kids. “So we made a round and then she was okay. She was looking forward to doing a little work. “With the kids in the station, it’s great. I just get down on their level and reach out… even though they don’t speak I’ll make the petting motion. “They’ll do a little petting of Juno or we’ll let them hold her if it looks like the kids have it together. “You could have a four-year-old in the middle of a full-blown temper tantrum, (Juno) can flip them out in 10 seconds and he’s smiling and giggling.” Asked how Juno’s pink hairdo came about, Mr Whelan said: “I had a toy poodle with my previous girlfriend and she didn’t like me to give the dog a mohawk. “So when I got Juno on my own, I’m like, she’s going to have whatever I want. She’s a little bit of a punk rocker.” The pair will continue to offer assistance in the area until mid-May, as the Russian invasion of Ukraine nears the two-month mark. Mr Whelan said he hopes people can see that many volunteers are attempting to make the situation better. “I like that Mr Rogers quote, you know – when something terrible happens, look for the people who are trying to do good and help,” he said. “You can see a lot of good in the world when you see how many people have really made an effort to come here, donate or work remotely to help these people. “I just like to put that out there, that there’s a lot of people making an effort to help these people and do what they can to make their situation better.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(483, '/news/uk/home-news/legal-action-rwanda-asylum-priti-patel-uk-b2063279.html', 7, 'independent', 'Priti Patel faces legal challenge against Rwanda deal', 'Priti Patel is already facing legal action against her plans to ship asylum seekers to Rwanda in what is likely to be the first of many challenges against the controversial policy. Lawyers representing an asylum seeker who is eligible for removal under the plans have lodged a judicial review application, arguing that sending him to the East African country would violate his human rights. They argue that the deal the British government has brokered with Rwanda, which will see people who have arrived in the UK to seek asylum sent 4,000 miles away to have their claims considered by the Rwandan authorities, breaks the law in multiple ways. The lawyers say it is in breach of both the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) – on the basis that it denies deportees proper access to the courts and is discriminatory - and the Geneva Convention, which stipulates that asylum seekers should not be penalised for their method of arrival. The lawyers also argue that the policy breaches the law on the basis that Rwanda cannot be considered a “safe country”, as the UK government claims. The solicitor bringing the case, Harjot Singh of Twinwood Law Practice, told The Independent: “We strongly feel that the [policy] is unlawful. I’ve got all my faith in the judicial system. I’ll leave it to the judges.” Zoe Bantleman, legal director and the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association, said there were likely to be further legal challenges. \"The government is not above the law, which lawyers are professionally and ethically charged to uphold without regard to their politics,” she said. “Further litigation, to challenge any failure by the UK to comply with its obligations under the law, is likely and will be necessary to maintain the rule of law.” She added: “We are deeply concerned that if this policy were to be found unlawful by our courts, the government would see our legal and constitutional framework as an impediment to its agenda and alter the law to weaken the protection of rights.” The multi-million pound deal, announced last week, is set to see asylum seekers who are deemed to be “inadmissible” – meaning they travelled through a safe country to reach Britain and therefore will not have their claim decided in the UK – deported to Rwanda to have their claims processed there. The UK’s inadmissibility rules, introduced in January 2021, stipulate that individuals deemed to be inadmissible can be removed to the safe country they travelled through if that country agrees to their return – or otherwise to “any safe third country that will take them”. Given that the UK has failed to strike any bilateral returns agreements with EU countries to enable it to send asylum seekers back to the continent, ministers hope the new migration deal will mean they can instead remove them to Rwanda. The agreement requires Rwanda to process claims in accordance with the UN Refugee Convention, ensuring protection from inhuman and degrading treatment.  However, the lawyers argue that there is “no mechanism in place to ensure that this is done”, adding that Rwanda has a “poor human rights record” and that asylum seekers in the country are “not treated in accordance with acceptable level of treatment accorded to them by international law”. They cite an Amnesty International report published in 2019 which describes an incident in February 2018 in which at least 11 Congolese refugees were killed when the police opened fire on protestors in Karongi town and in Kiziba refugee camp, both in Western Rwanda.  The report states that one year on, rather than investigating the unnecessary and/or excessive use of force by police, the Rwandan authorities have arrested and prosecuted refugees for their involvement in the protests. The lawyers also quote the US government latest Trafficking in Persons Report for 2021, which accuses the Rwandan authorities of detaining thousands of potential victims in district transit centres “without conducting adequate screening or referring identified victims to proper care and assistance”. The report adds the Rwandan government investigated fewer trafficking cases and prosecuted and convicted fewer traffickers compared to the previous year, and that it “lacked a victim-witness support program”. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Rwanda is a safe and secure country with a track record of supporting over 130,000 refugees, including through the UN Refugee Agency who themselves said the country has a safe and protective environment for refugees. “This agreement is in line with domestic and international legal obligations and we will defend any legal challenge robustly.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(484, '/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-fine-partygate-byob-b2063915.html', 7, 'independent', 'PM tipped to escape fine for ‘bring your own booze’ party he attended', 'Boris Johnson will escape a fine for the “bring your own booze” party he attended in the No 10 garden, a legal expert is predicting – despite others being punished. Downing Street says the prime minister has not yet received a fixed penalty notice for the event, which would have been his second fine in the Partygate crisis threatening his future. Mr Johnson has admitted attending the event in May 2020, held during the first lockdown when his own Covid rules had banned both indoor and outdoor social gatherings. His principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, is believed to have invited up to 100 people to the “socially distanced” evening drinks, in warm weather. But Adam Wagner, a human rights barrister and expert on the many changes in coronavirus legislation, cautioned against believing that meant a fine will follow. “I have said throughout I doubt the PM will get an FPN for this event as he was in his own home/garden,” he tweeted. Mr Wagner added that “rules at the time (changed 31 May) only penalised if you were outside the home without a reasonable excuse”. The ‘BYOB’ party is thought by some to be an event of maximum danger for Mr Johnson, because of an alleged “killer email” seen by Sue Gray, the head of the Cabinet Office inquiry. The senior official who sent it was thought to have provided evidence that the prime minister – as alleged by Dominic Cummings – was warned not to go ahead with it. He was reported to have warned Mr Reynolds to cancel the party, after which Mr Johnson’s close aide “came to his office” and “asked him why the party should be cancelled”. Mr Cummings claimed Mr Reynolds also told him he would “check with the PM if he’s happy for it to go ahead”, arguing any claim Mr Johnson was not consulted is “not credible.” The prime minister provoked ridicule by telling the Commons he “believed implicitly that this was a work event”. There was no such permitted event, under the Covid rules. Mr Johnson’s troubles have deepened after he failed to block a Commons inquiry into whether he lied to MPs, when he wrongly told them no rules were broken. One senior Tory has warned the Conservatives will “reap the whirlwind” of public anger over the parties at the ballot box on 5 May. The former minister Steve Baker – who told the prime minister the “gig’s up” on his premiership – said his constituents are expressing “fury” over the lockdown breaches. Other top Conservatives are predicting that a post-local elections challenge to Mr Johnson’s leadership is now inevitable, as MPs contemplate no end to the controversy.

(485, '/news/uk/politics/jacob-rees-mogg-working-bully-b2063843.html', 7, 'independent', 'Rees-Mogg leaves ‘nasty’ notes for civil servants working from home', 'Jacob Rees-Mogg is under fire after leaving bizarre notes on empty desks in an apparent attack on civil servants working from home. The Cabinet Office minister has been branded “a bully and “patronising” – while other critics suggested his job overseeing “Brexit opportunities” was failing to give him enough to do. The notes read: “Sorry you were out when I visited. I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon,” and are signed “with every good wish”. But the on-the-surface politeness comes after Mr Rees-Mogg wrote to all cabinet ministers, demanding “a clear message to civil servants in your department to ensure a rapid return to the office”. The minister, who is also in charge of “government efficiency” has also published a league table showing how many officials were at their desks on an average day this month. Dave Penman, the head of the civil servants’ union the FDA, said he was “not sure this is real” when he first saw the notes, which were shared on Twitter. “Haven’t seen one of those pristine green felt boards since I was a civil servant 25 years ago. If it is, it’s the most crass, condescending act I’ve seen from a minister,” he said. Helen Morgan, a Liberal Democrat MP called it “a pointless nasty gesture”, while Labour’s Justin Madders said: “Someone introduce him to email and Zoom please.” Others pointed to the infamous incident when Mr Rees-Mogg was photographed lolling on the Commons front bench, in September 2019. That act was described as “the physical embodiment of arrogance, entitlement and contempt for parliament” – and the starkest example of a minister “lying in parliament”. Other ministers have stepped up criticisms of departments and quangos which have retained “hybrid working” policies brought in because of Covid, requiring staff to be on site two days a week. But they have been accused of ignorance in arguing that working from home means civil servants are less productive or efficient in their working. Some officials say they have been told they can go into the office on a limited number of days, because there are no free desks or their building has been sold.

The formerVanity Fair editor’s new book, The Palace Papers: Inside the House of Windsor – the Truth and the Turmoil, continues where Brown left off in her previous book, The Diana Chronicles, just after the princess’ untimely death in a car crash in Paris. It details the next 30-odd years of the lives of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Brown spoke to more than 120 sources to put her new book together and writes in great detail about the betrayals, love affairs and scandals that Britain’s most important family has weathered in modern times. She chronicles the Queen’s stoicism in coming to terms with the deaths of Princess Margaret, the Queen Mother and, most recently, Prince Philip in the years since Diana’s tragic passing. Tina Brown, author of The Diana Chronicles and her new book, The Palace Papers The book also explores Prince Charles’ controversial relationship with Camilla, which became public a year after Diana’s death in 1997. It also delves into William and Harry’s increasingly-strained brotherhood and the allegations surrounding the Duke of York and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. Some of the most explosive claims include how Prince Charles may never get his mother’s approval because of his “vulnerable, self-centred” character, and that Buckingham Palace did not take the issue of race “seriously enough” until allegations of racism from Prince Harry and Meghan emerged. The author also writes about the nickname allegedly given to Andrew during his time as a pupil at Gordonstoun School in Scotland, as well as how the duke apparently reacted to his separation from his former wife, Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York. The Independent’s reviewer Sean O’Grady described The Palace Papers as a “vivid and richly-embroidered” book and a “mother lode of delectable royal gossip”. Brown promises that her new tome will “irrevocably change how the world sees the British royal family”. The Palace Papers: Inside the House of Windsor - The Truth and the Turmoil by Tina Brown is available from 26 April 2022.

The Who musician was one of the most prominent and vocal supporters of Brexit in the build-up to the EU referendum in 2016. In a new interview with The Independent, the 78-year-old stuck by his view that the European Union’s power is “too divorced from everyday people”, and said he wasn’t sorry for voting Leave. “I’m disappointed we haven’t made the most of it – I’m really disappointed that we haven’t burned an awful lot of useless regulation,” he said.  “I just put in planning permission for a building on the farm and just to get the planning in its cost me something like £40,000. It’s f***ing ridiculous. Who the bloody hell’s got that?” When it was pointed out to him that many regulations aren’t “forced” on the UK by the EU, Daltrey insisted “a lot of them are” and repeated his belief that the government hasn’t “made the most” of Brexit. “Would I vote to go back in it? No,” he said. “Am I sorry we came out of it? No… it’s a cartel, mate, it’s like being governed by FIFA.” Daltrey also complained about the difficulties currently facing musicians who wish to tour around Europe, as they face costly delays caused by red tape and the ongoing lorry queues at Dover.  “They’re making life hard for us, I don’t disagree,” he said. “It doesn’t need to be. One truck goes into Europe full of equipment with a carnet, it’s not hard to get visas, is it? It shouldn’t be. We used to do it regularly in the Sixties and Seventies.” Enjoy unlimited access to 70 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon Music Sign up now for a 30-day free trial He continued: “There’s no cooperation. They were always going to punish us; they’re determined to make it not work because they’re fearful of other countries leaving. Let’s see.” Daltrey previously made headlines in 2019 after snapping at a journalist who asked for his opinion on how Brexit would affect the UK music industry. “What’s it got to do with the rock business?” he asked at the time. When the journalist asked, “How are you going to tour in Europe?” Daltrey snapped back: “Oh dear. As if we didn’t tour Europe before the f***ing EU. Oh, give it up!” In 2021, he then defended himself against hypocrisy allegations after becoming one of over 100 musicians – along with Elton John, Ed Sheeran and Liam Gallagher – calling on the government to resolve the freedom of movement issue for British artists. “I have not changed my opinion on the EU,” Daltrey said in a statement. “I’m glad to be free of Brussels, not Europe. I would have preferred reform, which was asked for by us before the referendum and was turned down by the then president of the EU. “I do think our government should have made the easing of restrictions for musicians and actors a higher priority. Every tour, individual actors and musicians should be treated as any other ‘Goods’ at the point of entry to the EU with one set of paperwork.” In his interview with The Independent, Daltrey also discussed his memories of The Who, his 2018 memoir, forthcoming projects, his views on Partygate, and why The Who are unlikely to make a new album.

(489, '/news/health/trial-moon-shot-covid-vaccine-single-results-expected-b2063870.html', 7, 'independent', 'Trial of ‘moon shot’ vaccine that ‘protects against variants’ expected', 'The trial results of a new US Army-developed Covid-19 vaccine - described as a “moon shot” - could arrive within days, an expert has said. The preliminary results of the single-dose jab, which is said to protect people against all variants of coronavirus, have been hailed by Professor Luke O’Neill as “impressive”. According to the professor of biochemistry at Trinity College Dublin, the findings from the phase one trial on humans should be made public “any day now.” Professor O’Neill told Newstalk on Thursday: “This is now the Moon shot, they’re calling it in a way, the US are all over this. “Can we make a vaccine that will work against any variant of Covid-19? And indeed any in animals that might jump again in the next pandemic. “There’s a massive effort happening in the US at the moment, trying to make what’s called a Universal Vaccine. It’s a great goal to have”. The vaccine was first developed in America on animals, the test results from which Professor O’Neill said were impressive. “They’ve taken the RBD... and they’ve stuck it on a nano-particle, a tiny, tiny particle, made of a thing called ferritin, studded with loads of these RBDs,” he said. “[It] went into monkeys and amazingly it protects against SARS, the original virus, SARS-CoV-2, Alpha, Beta, Delta, Omicron. It protected against all of those in monkeys. “They’re in the middle of a phase one trial in humans - any day now actually, we’re going to get the data from that phase one trial soon. “That’s very, very hopeful that that US Army-derived vaccine could be the first universal vaccine against Covid-19”. Speaking earlier this week, Professor O’Neill said that the new Omicron XE - a mutation of the BA.1 and BA.2 strains - variant is 10-20 per cent more transmissible than the original Omicron. The earliest case of XE in Britain has a specimen date of 19 January 2022, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).  Professor O’Neill said on RTE Radio 1 earlier this week: “It’s like a deck of cards and it keeps getting reshuffled. “You know an immune system can recognise the same cards, basically. So far the worry would be a new deck of cards might emerge, or a different kind of suit of cards might emerge, and then we might be in more trouble, but for the moment as I say it’s the same deck of cards being reshuffled basically. “At the moment the vaccines are stopping serious illness against any variant so far, but again we have to watch it.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(495, '/news/business/recession-cost-living-sunak-b2063551.html', 5, 'independent', 'Confidence among shoppers falls to lowest since financial crash ', 'Confidence among shoppers has fallen to its lowest level since the 2008 financial crash as the soaring cost of living prompted a sharp drop-off in spending, new figures show. The disastrous economic data led analysts to warn that the crisis is at risk of turning into a full-blown recession with prices rising and shoppers tightening their belts. Struggling households cut back spending on online purchases, food and fuel, analysis found, while Rishi Sunak was told the public hasn’t been given the help they need. And economists are warning that much worse is likely to come, with the impact of huge increases to energy bills and rises in tax and National Insurance yet to hit. Official figures released on Friday showed retail sales fell 1.4 per cent in March, faster than February’s 0.5 per cent drop. Online spending was down 7.9 per cent as the lifting of Covid restrictions saw people return to buying in stores. Fuel sales tumbled 3.8 per cent as record petrol and diesel prices caused motorists to cut back on non-essential journeys. Energy and fuel costs have pushed up the price of several other goods from food to clothing, which sent inflation to 6.2 per cent − well above average pay rises. The squeeze on real incomes is now beginning to cause a crisis of confidence among shoppers, separate data showed. A closely watched consumer confidence index compiled by market research firm GfK fell to a level of -38 in April − the lowest level since 2008. The poll indicates that a further decline in spending is likely. The “rapid yet predictable” fall in spending had been made more severe government decisions to cut benefits and hike taxes, said George Dibb, head of the IPPR centre for economic justice. “Rishi Sunak’s decision to not adequately support households isn’t just a crisis for people struggling to get by, it actually risks tipping the UK economy into recession,” he said. The chancellor has been criticised for failing to announce more help for people unable to keep up with rising bills and a surge in inflation. A £150 council tax rebate and a repayable £200 reduction on energy costs have been widely seen as poorly targeted and inadequate. Energy bills for the average home are almost £1,000 a year higher than they were just over a year ago after the price cap jumped 54 per cent this month. Millions of Britain’s poorest households have also seen their incomes cut after the government refused to increase benefit payments in line with inflation. Mr Dibb warned that people will be looking for other places to save money as the cost of living crisis starts to bite, depressing the wider economy. “Cutting back on shopping, meals out, holidays, and streaming subscriptions are the first to go,” he said. James Smith, research director of the Resolution Foundation, said the risk of recession had increased and called on ministers to do much more to prevent one from occurring. Months of shrinking pay packets and worries about living costs have begun dragging down economic activity, he said. “A fresh downturn is far from certain, but the government should be doing all it can – and far more than it currently is – to help support those on low incomes who will be hardest hit.” Sam Tims, economist at the New Economics Foundation, said the policy announcements so far were nowhere near enough to deal with living cost increases. The decision not to increase benefits will harm the wider economy, he said.  “It has an individual impact of more people going hungry or being unable to heat their homes but there is also an economic impact.” Mr Tims said. “If people can’t spend money in the high street, in pubs and elsewhere, consumer spending will drop and that is something that is likely to lead to a recession.” He added he did not see the situation improving any time soon and called on the government to ensure everyone in the UK has a living income. “We are already seeing consumers adopt coping mechanisms to deal with the squeeze in incomes, such as seeking value and trading down,” Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said, adding: “We have also seen more resilience in spending across the older age groups, maybe reflecting that they were less impacted through lockdown in terms of finances but also are likely to be helping out their families.”', 'Friday 22 April 2022 19:04'),
(496, '/news/business/retail-cost-of-living-fuel-rise-b2063280.html', 5, 'independent', 'Retail sales plummet across UK as cost-of-living crisis bites ', 'Online sales took a heavy hit last month, with shoppers reining in unnecessary purchases as the cost-of-living crisis started to bite, according to official figures. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said sales volumes fell 1.4 per cent in March – faster than the 0.5 per cent drop in February – although they remain 2.2 per cent above pre-Covid levels of February 2020. Online sales bore the brunt, dropping 7.9 per cent in the month – following on from a 6.9 per cent fall in February. The ONS also revealed a decrease in fuel sales volumes of 3.8 per cent as soaring petrol and diesel costs put motorists off making unnecessary journeys, the ONS added. The only part of the retail landscape to see an increase in sales was in non-food stores, which were up 1.3 per cent, driven by a 2.6 per cent rise at household goods retailers including garden centres and DIY stores. ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said: “Retail sales fell back notably in March, with rises in the cost of living hitting consumers’ spending. “Online sales were hit particularly hard due to lower levels of discretionary spending. “Fuel sales also fell substantially, with evidence suggesting some people reduced non-essential journeys, following record high petrol prices, while food sales continued to fall, dropping for the fifth consecutive month.” The ONS suggested that the fall in online sales could be due to the end of lockdown restrictions and shoppers feeling confident returning to stores, when compared with December and January as the Omicron variant of coronavirus ran rampant. It also warned that “some of the fall in February and March 2022 may also be linked to affordability concerns” and pointed out that recent surveys found 54 per cent of adults reported spending less on non-essentials due to an increase in the cost of living. Food store sales volumes fell 1.1 per cent over the month, with households cutting back on excessive food purchases due to cost-of-living concerns. The ONS added that the decrease was also due to more shoppers preferring to spend their cash on eating out and socialising due to Covid-19 restrictions coming to an end. Economists and analysts suggested more falls could be on the way, as consumer confidence takes a knock. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “March’s substantial fall in retail sales volumes looks like the start of a period of weakness in consumers’ spending, rather than just a blip.” He added that this probably means a future Bank of England base rate rise is likely to be less than first thought. We are already seeing consumers adopt coping mechanisms to deal with the squeeze in incomes Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said: “Whilst we believe there will continue to be pent-up demand for certain categories as we plan for summer and a return to holidays, the squeeze on incomes will impact spending. “We are already seeing consumers adopt coping mechanisms to deal with the squeeze in incomes, such as seeking value and trading down.” She added: “We have also seen more resilience in spending across the older age groups, maybe reflecting that they were less impacted through lockdown in terms of finances but also are likely to be helping out their families.” Oliver Vernon-Harcourt, head of retail at Deloitte, said: “The next few months will see further disruptions to supply chains and cost pressures. “Consumers will also feel the pinch, particularly around discretionary spending, with April seeing the introduction of energy price cap rises and national insurance increases. The retail industry will need to balance increasing costs with maintaining customer engagement.” Consumers face even more challenges as the energy price cap rose to a record high this month And Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said: “The cost-of-living squeeze has many consumers thinking twice about major purchases, while their expectations of future financial situation plummeted to lows not seen since the financial crisis. “Consumers face even more challenges as the energy price cap rose to a record high this month.” She added: “Retailers are themselves squeezed between rising costs of operations, exacerbated by the situation in Ukraine, and weaker demand from customers. “Higher global commodity prices, rising energy and transport costs, and a tight labour market are all taking their toll. As a result, it is likely that retail prices will continue rise over the course of 2022.”', 'Friday 22 April 2022 12:55'),

The KitKat and Shreddies maker said it has already increased prices by more than 5 per cent over the first three months of 2022 but will look to further hikes. Mark Schneider, chief executive of the Swiss food group, said: “Cost inflation continues to increase sharply, which will require further pricing and mitigating actions over the course of the year.” Nestle saw sustained customer demand despite the jump in prices, Mr Schneider added. The group reported a 7.6 per cent increase in organic sales over the three months to March, driven by a 5.2 per cent increase in pricing and a 2.4 per cent rise in volumes.

The announcement came after the prime minister signalled a potential move to break the logjam in talks, by suggesting that he is ready to U-turn on immigration visas for thousands of Indians. Visas to study, work and settle in the UK have long been a top priority for Delhi in talks with the UK on improving commercial ties. London’s reluctance to open its doors is seen as the principal obstacle to the trade deal, which both sides have previously said they want to conclude by the end of this year. But Mr Johnson seemed ready to take a more accommodating line as he travelled to India for a two-day visit, which will include talks with the country’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, on Friday. Asked by reporters whether he would have anything to offer Mr Modi on visas, the prime minister immediately made reference to the UK’s need for “hundreds of thousands” of workers with in-demand skills, who are given favoured treatment under the post-Brexit points-based immigration system. “I have always been in favour of having people coming into this country,” said Mr Johnson. “We have a massive shortage in the UK, not least in experts in IT and programming. We are short to the tune of hundreds of thousands in our economy. “We need to have a professional approach, but it has got to be controlled.” Speaking later during a visit to a JCB factory in Gujarati capital Ahmedabad, the PM made clear he is impatient for a deal, which would be the biggest since the UK formally left the EU last year. “We’re hoping to complete another free trade agreement, with India, by the end of the year, by the autumn.” Negotiating teams will start their third round of formal talks in India next week on a trade deal. But sources have indicated that the process is at too early a stage for breakthroughs to be expected during the PM’s visit. Mr Johnson said that the commercial agreements and export deals to be announced during his trip are worth a total of £1bn and will create an estimated 11,000 jobs, mostly in the UK. They include a deal for a satellite company rescued from bankruptcy by Dominic Cummings using £400m of UK taxpayers’ money, which intends to launch rockets from India. Mr Johnson said that relations were boosted by the “living bridge” of people of Indian origin living in the UK, and that he himself has relatives by marriage living in India. He said that British politicians have to “respect and understand the sensitivities” of the UK’s history as imperial ruler of India, but added: “The great thing about the relationship today is that it is in a different place and it is less encumbered by that baggage.” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Boris Johnson in Glasgow last year  The long-awaited trip – twice postponed because of the Covid pandemic – means Mr Johnson is from Westminster for Thursday’s crucial vote on a parliamentary inquiry into allegations he committed contempt of the Commons by lying over Partygate. The visit threatens to be overshadowed by India’s refusal to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine, or to scale back its trading relationship with Moscow. India remains a significant consumer of Russia’s military and energy exports. However, Downing Street insists the prime minister will not attempt to “lecture” Mr Modi, but will instead offer “constructive” proposals for alternative sources in an effort to reduce the country’s reliance on Russia. Former aide Mr Cummings persuaded Mr Johnson to authorise the rescue of OneWeb against the objections of civil servants, after identifying the little-known company as a means by which post-Brexit Britain might establish a presence in the satellite communications market. It aims to put hundreds of small and relatively cheap satellites in a low orbit to provide broadband coverage all over the world, but faces competition from major players including Elon Musk and Amazon. Today’s deal follows last October’s letter of intent, signed jointly by OneWeb and NewSpace India Limited (NSIL) – a commercial arm of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) – in which OneWeb’s executive chair, Sunil Bharti Mittal, set out plans to use two Indian-built vehicles as potential platforms to launch satellites from the country. The company recently called off planned launches from Russia’s Bakonur space facility in Kazakhstan because of last-minute demands from Moscow. Other agreements announced by Mr Johnson as he arrived in the west Indian state of Gujarat included:  The UK will confirm new science and tech collaborations, including a digital health partnership, new AI scholarships for Indian students, and a £6m investment by AI healthcare specialists Qure-ai to fund the opening of a centre of excellence in the UK.', 'Thursday 21 April 2022 11:13'),

The changes mean branches will operate from 9.30 am to 3 pm on weekdays, instead of until 4.30 pm. The bank said branch staff will still be available for pre-booked face-to-face appointments between 3 pm and 5 pm if customers need support that cannot be provided through alternative channels or earlier in the day. A handful of branches situated in shopping centres will be excluded from the changes. These include the Gateshead Metro branch, which will open Monday to Friday from 10 am to 6 pm; the Sheffield Meadowhall branch will open on weekdays from 10.30 am to 7.30 pm; and the Basingstoke branch will be open Monday to Friday from 9.30 am to 7 pm. We have seen a continuing reduction in branch usage over several years, both before and since the peak of the pandemic, with many customers preferring to transact digitally or contact us by phone The Work Cafe in Leeds will also be open on weekdays between 9 am and 4.30 pm, Santander said. The bank said the number of customers using its branches fell by a third (33 per cent) over the two years before the coronavirus pandemic and a further 50 per cent in 2020 and 12 per cent in 2021. The changes will take place from 18 July and Santander said there will be no compulsory redundancies or a reduction of employee working hours as a result. The bank plans to beef up its telephone support for customers and said branch staff will be trained to help on the phone alongside their current face-to-face roles. The shake-up will also see 316 branches move from being open from 9.30 am to 4 pm on Saturdays to operating a half-day service, closing at 12.30 pm. Face-to-face appointments can still be made at these branches until 4 pm. Meanwhile, 76 branches will retain their current half-day opening hours on a Saturday, and 58 sites will remain closed on a Saturday. There will be no branch closures as part of the changes, Santander said, adding that all of its 450 sites will remain open every weekday. There will also be no change in the number of branches open on a Saturday, with 87 per cent sites operating from 9.30 am to 12.30 pm. The bank said the changes reflect a thorough review of when customers use its branches. Most Santander bank branches will operate reduced hours from mid-July Richard Owen, head of branches at Santander, said: “These changes will enable us to maintain our existing branch network while providing significant additional capacity to help customers who want to talk to us by phone. “We have seen a continuing reduction in branch usage over several years, both before and since the peak of the pandemic, with many customers preferring to transact digitally or contact us by phone. “We want to make sure we have the right mix of channels to help our customers however they choose to bank with us.” Santander said it will be writing to regular branch customers to explain the new opening hours and to offer support. Bank branch and ATM closures in recent years have sparked concern about people being easily able to access their money. The Government has said it will legislate to protect the future of cash. Several industry initiatives have been taking place, such as cashback in shops, and shared “banking hubs”. Santander said it remains actively committed to the wider access to cash movement, with representation on several industry working groups and participation in the Cash Action Group’s shared hub initiative.', 'Thursday 21 April 2022 10:52'),

Part of this must include a platform such as Priority Digital Health’s Priority Platform. Why? Because using this digital solution, they can help hard-to-reach communities, and flexibility scale up to the levels that they need to support the relevant locations. All this can be gained without having to find more resources, more money and more expertise. The future is interoperability, flexibility, and whole-body health services all in one place – that’s why the future is the Priority Platform. Priority Digital Health (PDH) is a Cambridge-based organisation specialising in digital health solutions. PDH build digital solutions which empower better self-management and service-management of patients’ health and wellbeing. They ensure people get the help and support they need, swiftly, whilst remaining true to their ’Tell Your Story Once’ mantra. PDH’s speciality is disease prevention; their background is in changing behaviour, and their focus is cost-saving and service efficiencies – but not at the expense of user experience. They have three main products: The Priority Platform (customisable case management software); Diabetes Book & Learn (connecting people with Diabetes to the right education); and AmaraHealth™ (a whole-body health and wellbeing app). The Priority Platform was created by Priority Digital Health, a Cambridge-based organisation specialising in digital health solutions. The Priority Platform is a case management system that acts as a digital portal for all patient information, vaccinations, prescriptions, appointments, interactions, goals and encounters within healthcare settings. This includes wellbeing services, GPs and social prescribing organisations. Anyone internally or externally involved with a patient’s care can be connected via one centralised system. Patients can self-refer, record their own health and wellbeing metrics, and manage their own data. Naturally, this increases ownership and accountability while generating greater efficiencies and savings for the service providers. Interoperability isn’t at the core of many digital health services. Most platforms solve one problem and require a new platform when another problem arises. This is costly, timely, complicated – and usability suffers. But the Priority Digital Health Priority Platform has interoperability at its core. Already accessible to over seven million UK residents, the Priority Platform is fully interoperable and can be connected to all the major GP clinical systems such as Vision and TPP. One of the most unique features of the Priority Platform is that there’s one login for one platform, but many different modules within that platform which deliver different services. As a result, it’s easily customised for each service and every local pathway.The platform hosts a multitude of award-winning service modules. These support a range of NHS, public health and community services. This includes social prescribing, booking, volunteering, goal-setting, lifestyle services (such as smoking and weight management) and workplace health services. Customers may acquire a singular module and then decide they need more. PDH’s flexible approach allows them to make that happen quickly, without the obstacle of an entirely new platform. Their platform has been designed with security at its core: Priority Digital Health is bringing a new product to market. It’s whole-body health like you’ve never seen before, that encourages patients to delete their countless health and wellbeing apps and replace them with AmaraHealth™. Why? Because AmaraHealth™ enables people to simplify their use of health apps by streamlining them into one. Using the AmaraHealth™ app, users will be able to track all areas of their health and wellbeing. From physical fitness to mood, every aspect of a patient’s health can be tracked manually or via a connected wearable. Users will be empowered to achieve and sustain whole-body health, with access to their unique wellbeing score, personalised analytics and specialist courses, videos and articles. Just like the Priority Platform, AmaraHealth™will empower individuals to take control of their health and wellbeing, helping to alleviate the pressure on healthcare professionals and services. If the future is in favour of interconnectivity and ease for both patients and healthcare systems, then it’ll be in favour of digital solutions such as the Priority Platform and AmaraHealth™ too.

As the UK approaches its second anniversary of remote/hybrid working, this new way of life looks like it is here to stay. For the most part, workers are keen for this to be the case. RingCentral’s recent survey found that one-quarter of British workers claimed they would look for another job if forced back to the office and 63 per cent believe that connecting online or via voice or video calls is just as good as meeting in person. As work from anywhere quickly becomes the norm, business leaders must take the time to audit their interim communications solutions. It’s crucial now that forward-thinking business leaders acknowledge employees’ desire for better workplace flexibility. As 66 per cent of homeworkers claim they’d prefer to continue working remotely, it’s essential that businesses put the infrastructure in place to ensure they retain their staff and continue to operate with technology that stands the test of time. As teams and colleagues increasingly connect online and from afar, circumstances have put business communications solutions well and truly in the limelight. With cloud communications now at the heart of most businesses, teams must assess their needs and the possible opportunities for unlocking better working relationships and efficiencies. In the weeks leading up to the initial wave of the health crisis, businesses had to focus on managing the immediate impact, quickly pivoting and putting continuity measures in place that were often in the form of cloud-based tools. Now, as businesses continue to navigate the impact of the ongoing pandemic, workers find themselves juggling a number of different key tools and technologies. With many team members spread across different regions and territories, the lack of cohesion afforded by disparate systems can be very limiting and harm team efficiency and productivity. In contrast, having access to one joined-up set of collaboration tools stands business teams in good stead for better teamwork, productivity and flexibility and for the scalability required to evolve in the future. The past two years have proven that having the right unified communications and collaboration (UC&C) solutions in place can really simplify the world of work. For example, in the public sector alone, organisations have been able to offer citizens better access and drive service efficiencies to improve the experience across the board. Examples of how UC&C has improved the citizen and worker experience include: With an increasing reliance on cloud communications and collaboration tools, analysts and industry commentators predict that we’ll see an increase in workplace communications being mined for intelligence and insights. According to Gartner, only one-quarter of enterprise meetings will be held in person by 2024, and 75 per cent of business conversations will be recorded and analysed by 2025. This business intelligence evolution is beginning to have huge implications for business operations. With productivity, innovation and commercial benefits, businesses across all industries and departments are considering how unified communications could play a huge role in their business progression and take digital transformation to the next stage. As a result of increasing demand, communications providers are increasingly harnessing artificial intelligence (AI), looking to integrate cutting-edge technology into their platforms. This additional element, which takes online collaboration to a whole new level, allows business users to harness the full potential of communications data for their customers, streamline operations and better support staff so they are free to problem-solve and innovate. With AI, businesses can rely on technology to automatically make notes during meetings and provide action lists, meeting summaries and minutes. Soon, we’ll see innovations such as intelligence automation (IA), which focuses on making computers as smart as humans. As technology evolves and digital transformation accelerates and takes on new meaning, dedicated UC&C providers will gradually begin to offer these IA-powered services to augment an enterprise’s intelligence. In addition to providing customers with AI-powered live transcriptions, meeting summaries, auto framing and speaker tracking, RingCentral has acquired and integrated DeepAffects, a leading conversational intelligence pioneer. This allows us to provide our customers with the tools to analyse business conversations and extract meaningful insights. This new wave of deeply intelligent tech will allow enterprise teams not only to gain easier access to knowledge from wherever they work but also to rely on their technology to provide interpretation and innovation to any employee. Forward-thinking businesses that choose to work with the right UC&C providers to put AI and IA technology in place will unleash a new world of potential and allow themselves to find the perfect point of productivity. Those that choose to invest in the right UC&C tools will unlock significant efficiencies, enhance their decision-making and improve customer experience. Partnering with the providers that focus on innovation will mean businesses can truly prepare for the workplace of tomorrow and make use of technology to reveal valuable intelligence, drive productivity and give themselves an edge over the competition. The organisations that act now to embrace the technologies that facilitate better hybrid and remote working will be taking the best steps to ensure they’re ready and their workers are equipped for whatever the future holds for the new world of work.

For any documents – from important contracts and business proposals to product packaging and web copy – the presence of typos and thoughtless errors can reflect poorly on the quality of a company’s services and demonstrate a lack of attention to detail. It can even result in widespread delays, product recalls or legal repercussions. Documents and artworks originating from multiple languages and frequent changes within the design process – such as in packaging – mean mistakes are almost inevitable. Errors and misprints can not only harm a company’s reputation but are also costly to fix. Thorough proofreading and correction are crucial.

Regardless of whether employees are in high or low risk situations, Peoplesafe’s products and services provide employers with the means to not only meet their duty of care obligations but surpass them. By providing a safety feature that can be accessed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, staff benefit from the service whether they are on or off duty. Whether an employer needs technology to keep workers safe from harm or just to safeguard their wellbeing, Peoplesafe has a solution. Available products range from discreet SOS alarms with fall detection, GPS tracking and two-way audio, to the Peoplesafe app, which transforms a smartphone into a personal safety device. And with public-facing workers facing increased incidents of verbal or physical abuse, Peoplesafe’s body-worn cameras act as a deterrent, and work to de-escalate a situation before anyone gets hurt. The company has also recently launched its own mass notification service, Peoplesafe Alert, which is designed for instant communication with employees in a crisis (such as a natural disaster or terror attack). It allows organisations to send and track mass safety messages to thousands of employees simultaneously, overriding phones set to silent or do not disturb. It also has geofencing capabilities, allowing an employer to communicate with those in a certain location. Peoplesafe’s fully accredited ARC is certified to the highest industry standards. It is operated by highly trained, experienced staff who are experts at handling crisis situations and alerts. The ARC is there to support an employee at any point where they feel their safety is compromised. Whether experiencing verbal or physical abuse or suffering a slip, trip or fall, they can activate their device and gain instant access to a call handler at the ARC. Via the two-way audio capability, the call handler will be able to speak to the user and assess the situation. Where necessary, we can bypass the 999 service using our Unique Reference Numbers (URNs) to speak directly to localised police control rooms, saving valuable time in an emergency. The ARC handles over half a million calls per year and deals with more than 600 incidents. As well as having priority access to emergency services, which has saved lives, our service has the potential to deflate a heated situation or find help for a fallen worker, thus reducing the volume of calls to the UK’s 999 emergency service. It is important to note that the two-way audio devices and GPS tracking services are only engaged when the user presses the SOS button. Employees are never tracked or listened to unless the alarm is raised. Peoplesafe helps to protect over 170,000 employees across a number of well-known organisations from the NHS and police forces to the Ministry of Justice, DEFRA, HMRC and the Forestry Commission. The company also counts private sector organisations such as Yorkshire Water, Taylor Wimpey and Engie among its client base. Naz Dossa, CEO of Peoplesafe, said: “Employee trends have changed dramatically over the past 18 months, with a huge increase in the number of staff working alone either at home or in a socially distanced environment. “This means that employers face new challenges in their duty of care, which is where Peoplesafe can supply up-to-the-minute technology-based solutions that provide security and peace of mind. “We pride ourselves on putting people at the heart of safety. Using tech-enabled end-to-end services that are driven by safety security systems is the best way to keep our workforces safe, no matter whether they are working or in their personal time.” Book a free consultation at safe.peoplesafe.co.uk/best-of-british Originally published on Business Reporter', 'Wednesday 20 April 2022 10:52'),
(517, '/news/business/business-reporter/stop-stalling-address-data-integrity-b2057887.html', 5, 'independent', 'It’s time to stop stalling and address data integrity', 'nChain is a Business Reporter client The European Parliament’s resolution on the integrity of online gambling called on member states to make harm reduction and fraud prevention top priorities. The resolution concluded that online gambling “combines several risk factors” that make protecting players especially important, and called for thorough investigation. I couldn’t agree more. Responsible gaming is an immensely consequential issue. There’s only one problem: that EU resolution is dated Tuesday, 10 March 2009. Thirteen years of stagnation leads to frustration. In that time, millions of people have been harmed. In the United Kingdom alone, it’s estimated that more than five million people have experienced harm related to problematic online gambling. Much of this harm, research shows, can be prevented through technological intervention and regulation that protects players from themselves and prevents fraud. It’s quite amazing how player data can be analysed to identity problematic behaviour before it escalates, preventing harm and promoting a healthier industry. Governments and gaming organisations have been working together to investigate these data-driven regulation strategies, and for far longer than a decade. We’re heard tales of countless committees, review boards, regulatory departments, slap-on-the-wrist fines, and more investigations than a police department. Now, I don’t want to sound cynical, but you’ll notice frustration in my tone. Because the tools and technologies to solve these challenges are already available. Regulators just need to agree to their use. And we may hear misinformed concerns about the cost of implementing new technologies, but we shouldn’t forget that the cost of inaction is measured in human suffering – addiction, depression, economic strife, and suicide. At the heart of this prevarication is a data challenge that’s rampant across industries. For years, we have believed that data would save the world. If we could just stall a bit longer, collect a bit more data, we would have models that enable near perfect decision-making. Unfortunately, if unsurprisingly, that hasn’t happened. Every week we read about another company investing in the latest AI-powered analytics tool, acquiring a hot new start-up with “data” in its name, or announcing how successful its data management and governance framework has been. How is it then that most decision-makers report that they are likely to disregard a data-driven insight that conflicts with their own intuitions? We’ve invested billions in data and analytics, but in the end the boss still goes with their hunch. The reason is not a lack of data, it’s a lack of data integrity. If we don’t have complete confidence in the data we rely on, it’s effectively worthless. Simply put, data integrity is the reliability and trustworthiness of data throughout its lifecycle. It is a measurement of our confidence that data hasn’t been changed, corrupted, abused or manipulated. Even perfectly valid and verified data can’t be trusted if it isn’t managed, stored and shared using systems that prioritise trustfulness and immutability. Data integrity challenges explain the stagnation in online gambling industry regulations. For one example, regulators want gaming operators to prove their compliance with standards for how, when and how much they communicate with players about potential markers of harm. How could an operator do that? A promise surely wouldn’t suffice. The operator could keep a log of those communications, but that’s open for manipulation. It could use a third-party to store evidence of that communication, but that too holds potential for bribery, abuse or fraud. The answer is to store the evidenced records of that communication on an immutable ledger. Externally auditable, decentralised and trustworthy, an immutable ledger can create true data integrity. The only way to trust data is to use systems that don’t require you to. This is not just true for online gambling. It also rings true across industries. Data is a tool for better decision-making. However, until we address data integrity in a real and sweeping way, data collection and analysis are a waste of time and resources. Unless, of course, the goal itself is this pantomime of progress we see play out in headlines and interviews. Given my criticism is of rampant inaction, I’d like to be as action-oriented as possible. When it comes to data integrity, I believe there are several ways for business leaders to identify the issue in their own organisations and to take steps towards overcoming it. First and foremost is accepting that data integrity is a fundamental challenge. Decision-makers must turn a critical eye towards their own organisations. Ask how important data is for your decision-making. How often do you find the data “coincidentally” matching your gut instinct (a potential sign of confirmation bias)? How often are you ignoring data you think is questionable and setting a course based on your own personal beliefs? Difficult questions to answer honestly, but those answers will certainly be revealing. Studies show that business leaders having full confidence in their data insights is exceedingly rare. So there’s no shame in recognising a truth that also plagues most, if not all, of your peers. It may appear that the solution is working to identify and correct existing errors in your data. But with the acceleration of its collection and its increasing complexity, that has become a near-Herculean task. Instead, you have to integrate systems for managing data that remove the chance for manipulation or corruption at a foundational level. To avoid the risk of exposing my bias, I won’t speak to the work we’re doing at nChain to solve these exact challenges, the products we have in the market right now, or the successes we’ve had. Instead, I would encourage you to reach out to multiple firms that prioritise data integrity and see whether they, like too many firms, are also stalling with promises of what will one day be possible. My last piece of advice is to avoid a trap. Don’t let “investigating” immutable ledger technology be the way your business stalls. Invest in running a pilot programme instead. Don’t expect your work to replace industry regulations overnight, but do understand that they will run in parallel to existing systems until proven by undeniable results. For the online gaming industry, as for so many others, until your decisions are founded on data you can truly trust, the only valid decision is to stop stalling and invest in data integrity.

For years we’ve seen reports of bias against people of colour in facial recognition software and sexist credit card algorithms. As recently as 2020, just 5.5 per cent of new hires that year were black. Historically, the space has been seen as dominated by white men. According to a survey, the total estimated black, hispanic, and indigenous population of Silicon Valley sat at a paltry 5 per cent. And that was pre-pandemic. Then there’s the impact of the pandemic itself. We know the pandemic opened up some opportunities for minority groups – moving to remote working made a lot of roles more accessible to people with disabilities, for example. We also know that it hindered efforts to increase more diverse hiring significantly across multiple sectors, and had a greater negative impact on working women compared with their male peers. And there’s one more thing the pandemic impacted – it transformed the face of the tech sector, in many ways for good. In 2020, the pandemic triggered a frenzied dash for companies in nearly every sector to provide their services or products virtually, practically overnight. This process, known as digital transformation, has been a buzzword in recent years, but its roots go as far back as the late nineties, and during and after lockdowns, it became increasingly essential for businesses looking to survive in modern, digital-first markets. In fact, it’s so essential in a post-pandemic world that leading figures have estimated that nearly two years’ worth of digital transformation was conducted in the first two months of the pandemic alone. And it hasn’t shown any signs of slowing down just yet. In 2019, it was estimated that the skills gap had an estimated $302 billion impact on business – in just one year. Since then, the tech skills gap has grown so much this figure has been revised to $775bn worldwide. And in a sector where skilled professionals were already in incredibly short supply, many companies’ attempts to rebuild after the pandemic and undergo digital transformation have – quite simply – been decimated. Nearly 80 per cent of IT decision-makers surveyed in 2021 consider a lack of digital skills as the number one challenge for meeting present and future business needs. With so few tech professionals available, businesses have fast become over-reliant on increasingly in-demand contractors, and many companies have fallen behind on critical digital transformation projects. This is a huge problem for tech, for two reasons. Firstly, when candidates are already in short supply, diversity becomes an issue that fewer and fewer companies can devote resources to improving. This risks locking women, people of colour, and other marginalised groups out for good, undoing years of collective work to improve the diversity in our sector. Secondly, such a short supply of candidates in the space could inhibit the overall economic recovery of the sector and lead to billions in lost revenue. Ultimately, if the tech skills gap is not closed in the next five years, we could risk losing $12 trillion in global GDP revenue by 2028. Historically, the lack of representation in tech has been an incredibly complex challenge, often compounded by the skills gap seen across multiple technologies. Not only has talent creation in the sector struggled to keep up with the demand for talent, but the talent that has been generated has been predominantly white and male. These problems are complex and intersectional: the more the skills gap grows, the less able companies are to improve their diversity, which subsequently narrows their scope for finding new candidates and increases their skills gap yet again. When we created Revolent, we knew that our sector’s best answer for bridging the skills gap was to focus on diversity, so we made sure that encouraging diverse and inclusive hiring was one of our core organisational strategies. Diversity and the skills gap may be our two biggest foes, but they are by no means unrelated. It’s not like it was 20 years ago, when you’d need to pay hefty bootcamp or college fees to learn a specialist IT technology. Theoretically, anyone with an internet connection can learn the basics of cloud technologies, as the internet has levelled access to learning resources. What is often lacking is the support and opportunity to apply that knowledge in practice. All it takes is for the right organisation, with a proper understanding of how to build diverse tech teams, to come along and match professionals who are interested in reskilling or cross-training with the thousands of businesses out there that desperately need their help. Which is what we’ve been doing since 2019. At Revolent, we recruit existing tech professionals from a diverse range of backgrounds and cross-train them in core technologies. We help individuals begin an incredible new career in the cloud, and we help businesses by providing the talent they’re so desperately in need of. And it’s working. Each year we’re partnering with more and more companies to build diverse talent pipelines, as people are realising that our business model allows us to flexibly and quickly plug skills gaps across a broad range of technologies. And that very flexibility that has been our success? It comes directly from our ability to widen the net and source from a more diverse range of hiring pools than traditional recruitment routes. Research shows that now, more than ever, the most successful companies are those that actively champion diversity. And, when it comes to cloud technologies, diversity is no longer just a moral imperative, it’s essential for our survival and growth as a sector.

(519, '/news/business/business-reporter/connectivity-revolution-manage-climate-risks-b2057892.html', 5, 'independent', 'A connectivity revolution to manage climate risks', 'Access Partnership is a Business Reporter client Unhampered access to satellite communication tools can serve as a systemic solution in reducing the economic impact of climate disasters That climate change is the gravest existential threat that confronted mankind is an understatement. The upward trajectory in the prevalence of climate-related disasters has massively devastated the state of human life, with cities being submerged, properties being damaged, and livelihoods being displaced. The havoc caused by a changing climate becomes even more profound when measured in terms of the overall economic impact it caused, not just on account of massive property losses, but more so through the heavy toll on human mortality and morbidity. Global Increase in Natural Disasters The concept of systemic risk pertains to the breakdown of an entire system as opposed to the simple failure of individual parts. In finance, this represents a risk of cascading failure which creates a ripple effect that could bring about the collapse of a whole system. We have seen witnessed how this panned out in the 2008 financial crisis, wherein a seemingly isolated mortgage bubble led to the greatest recession of our generation. In the same way, climate change is fast becoming a systemic risk that poses dire ramifications on the state of prevailing economic structures as we know it. Already, the signs are there. Various models backed up by science and data suggests that the economic impact of climate-induced disasters is expected to rise significantly in the coming decade. Assuming a conservative estimate that the cost of natural disasters continues to grow at their historical pace, the average annual economic impact of natural disasters will almost double by 97 per cent, from USD199 billion in 2015-19 to a staggering USD390 billion in 2025-29. To put things in perspective, this will make climate-related disasters the same size as the world’s 37th largest economy (per 2021 IMF figures), corresponding to almost 0.5 per cent of global GDP. Economic Impact of Natural Disasters Again, this is merely a conservative estimate. With the continued unpredictability of climate change, the economic damage resulting from disasters will rise exponentially. Apart from directly measurable effects, there are also significant social and cultural factors which further exacerbates the impact of climate disasters. Among others, these include labour productivity losses and displacement of families due to environmental migration. Just as financial systemic risks may bring about the collapse of entire systems, climate change may trigger increasing disruptions in our normal routines that will forever alter the course of human existence. Controlling systemic risks requires synchronised action from all stakeholders which stand to be affected. Fortunately for humankind, technology is one of the tools that could potentially be harnessed to respond to this existential threat. Governments and the private sector alike have recognised that emerging innovations in communications could be leveraged as an enabling element to support climate change adaptability. An effective deployment of these tools has improved the responsiveness of states to combat climate emergencies, thus forestalling more severe economic losses both in their preparation phase and in their aftermath. The outcomes that could play out as a result of differences in adapting to modern emergency communication tools have been mapped out by Access Partnership and its Fair Tech Institute in a whitepaper they recently released on the role of communications in disaster management. Accordingly, three scenarios are seen to emerge: Stark differences may result from how these scenarios pan out. On the one hand, maintaining the status quo runs the risk of significant disruptions to human life, which could further accelerate in the years to come. On the other hand, a utopian word where connectivity revolution is achieved could translate to an estimated US$148 billion reduction in economic damage, including a significant decline in preventable lives lost and people affected from natural disasters from 2025-2029. The vision that we should strive to achieve does not get any clearer than this. That climate change amounts to a systemic risk means that it is now the concern of everyone. Fundamental to humanity’s response to this threat is a recognition that climate action is not just the job of a select few, but a collaborative effort of each and everyone on the planet to ensure our continued survival. If we are truly to realise the potential of emerging emergency communication tools as a way to avert climate-related risks, it is imperative to bridge the existing divide in providing access to these technologies. Attaining full-scale connectivity revolution would not only drastically lessen the climate-related economic impact of disasters, but would also guarantee that no one is left behind in confronting this generational crisis.

And why shouldn’t they be? We’ve all got so used to technology personalising our everyday experiences – from streaming services to shopping – that we now expect it in all walks of life, learning included. Fortunately, most L&D teams and business leaders are also in favour of personalisation, recognising the value of highly targeted, relevant learning that helps people do their jobs better rather than putting the entire workforce through a sheep dip exercise. This has led to the emergence of personalised learning, which is when content and training are tailored to learner profiles. Learning is personalised to the individual, such as a feed of content that will help an employee do their job better. Adaptive learning is more sophisticated and dynamic, going a bit deeper. It’s an extension of personalised learning that is largely AI-driven, tailored to what a person knows and their level of capability and, as that knowledge and those capabilities change, adapts in real-time. Adaptive learning understands where an employee is at on their learning journey and can provide personalised learning at scale in organisations. Both types of learning are data-driven. They take data on an individual’s existing skills and knowledge and use it to suggest and deliver learning that will move them on to the next level. That process then keeps repeating throughout the employee’s learning journey. One of the real beauties of personalised learning is that employees don’t need to repeat information they already know. In the past, employees often had to sit through training material they’d already learnt, which was a waste of time and resources and a real turn-off for learners. With adaptive learning, content is targeted, relevant and timely. At Rise Up, we think there are two approaches to adaptive learning: macro-adaptive and micro-adaptive. Macro-adaptive focuses on personalised training pathways, while micro-adaptive focuses on personalised training content. New research is being conducted all the time into L&D trends, and personalised learning and adaptive learning have been near the top for a few years now. But it took a while for learning teams to get to grips with personalised and adaptive learning, largely because L&D wasn’t sure what to do with the data it was collecting. Organisations with effective adaptive learning practices know how to interpret data and use it to drive learning forward. By making good use of data, learning professionals can make informed decisions about what learning is needed, where and why – and they can track its effectiveness. Even before the pandemic hit, it was generally accepted that the old approach to learning – the one-size-fits-all, bums-on-seats approach – was outdated and didn’t deliver the best outcomes. This has enabled blended learning to flourish, facilitating a highly personalised and adaptive delivery. It allows people to learn through a variety of different mediums and channels according to their needs and preferences and those of their organisation. The move to remote working during the pandemic and then to hybrid working broke down barriers to digital learning. With the rise of the hybrid work environment, it’s even more important that employees have access to personalised learning, wherever they are based. Learning teams need to push ahead with ensuring employees have a really engaging, personalised learning experience. An organisation’s people are its best asset and they need to be looked after, with their skills nurtured and developed. Employers need to help employees do their best work by giving them access to the right learning, when they need it, while also fulfilling their career aspirations. Personalised learning is the key to achieving that. L&D proved its worth during the early days of Covid-19, helping organisations and employees in the shift to digital ways of working and learning. Business leaders realised the pivotal role that learning plays, particularly through times of change and uncertainty. In 2021, it shifted from being a ‘nice to have’ to becoming a ‘need to have’, and learning budgets are looking pretty healthy – lots of L&D teams expect their budget to increase this year. So L&D teams need to think wisely and creatively about their spending, how to bring about change and how to keep hold of that seat at the top table. Providing employees with personalised, adaptive learning experiences has been a top priority for long enough – now is the time for it to become a reality. Rise Up delivers a dynamic and impactful learning experience through an all-in-one training solution that facilitates personalised employee learning. With an AI-driven adaptive learning capability, Rise Up is leading the way to incorporate experience, culture, need, impact and agility.

(521, '/news/business/business-reporter/active-ownership-investors-engagement-b2057900.html', 5, 'independent', 'Active Ownership – a way for investors to engage', 'DWS is a Business Reporter client Businesses have been paying markedly more attention to environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues over the past years. Understandably, given the climate emergency, much of the world’s focus has been on environmental factors, with the Covid-19 pandemic also putting social issues such as worker rights and health and safety to the fore. Governance, the area where investors first engaged with non-financial – or extra-financial – issues, has increased in recent years: in 2021 DWS discussed governance topics in 74 per cent of overall engagements. It can be the bedrock of all the other issues, says Nicolas Huber, head of corporate governance at German asset manager DWS. “The tone from the top is important,” he explains. “Companies with weaker corporate governance structures could be more vulnerable to financial and extra-financial risks. Corporate governance practices can also influence a company’s management of environmental and social factors.” Intact governance, Huber points out, give companies a far better chance of effectively managing these areas. Good ESG isn’t just ethically appropriate: it’s also good for business. “A good understanding of governance is an important source of higher shareholder returns. It helps companies – and investors – to identify risks and opportunities that normal financial analysis may miss,” says Huber. “It’s part of our fiduciary duty, but it’s more than that. I strongly believe effective corporate governance is important to ensure that companies are in good position to face future challenges.” A concern for corporate governance is also increasingly important for clients. In the past, Huber says, asset owners would just ask if their managers had a policy and a framework in place. “Now there are detailed questions around how we vote, with whom we have engaged and on what. There is a much more sophisticated approach from clients now, driven in part by stewardship codes in countries such as the UK.” Engagement with management and supervisory boards is one of the most important ways that investors can influence a company’s corporate governance and its performance on sustainability. “When we engage, we have an escalation process,” Huber explains. “When you are invested in a company, you have the opportunity to effect change. When you’re not invested, it is more difficult to make a difference.” In 2021, DWS increased its engagement efforts to more than 581. “One example of where engagement has made a difference is in the area of remuneration packages”, he adds. Years ago, remuneration plans were in many ways very complicated, not at all transparent and often had no clear KPIs, especially in the long-term incentives. “We discussed this topic in many of our engagements and we have seen some improvements over the past years.” Companies started to integrate non-financial performance indicators into their remuneration systems, as awareness of companies’ double materiality grew. Greenhouse gas emissions, water and energy use, biodiversity, health and safety and diversity are increasingly finding their way into executive remuneration policies and DWS expects its investee companies to integrate material ESG factors into their thinking and strategy, as well as to establish and demonstrate a clear link between their stated ESG targets/non-financial KPIs and their remuneration systems. “One example is a company from the materials sector in Germany, with whom we had an intense dialogue with for nearly two years,” says Huber. “The progress presents true development and can be regarded as a successful engagement leading to a more transparent and shareholder-friendly remuneration system, including a 40 per cent weighting of sustainability within the long-term performance plan, for example on CO2-emissions.” Of the 430 governance engagements that DWS conducted in 2021, more than half covered executive remuneration for which processes were in place where improvements could be made. Following an update to the DWS voting policy in 2021, many of the conversations on this topic included sustainability-linked KPIs in order to tie in extra-financial priorities to executive pay packages. Board independence is another topic where DWS is very active. “If you have sat on a board for more than 10 years, you are more likely to be less critical of a company’s management. We discussed this topic in 147 engagements, for example with a company from Hong Kong operating in the consumer discretionary sector that will now look for replacements of its long-tenure directors to improve the board’s independence,” Huber points out. DWS aims to link their engagement activity to their voting behaviour. As a global asset manager, DWS is invested in many companies, but because of the number of holdings they focus on those companies for which they have, for example, significant holdings, special regional focus with sustainability and/or governance concerns. To ensure transparency on its governance standards and to outline its expectations as an active owner, DWS has published its Corporate Governance & Proxy Voting Policy online. “We have our own DWS corporate governance DNA developed over the past 25 years which considers also international best practice, various governance codes and international frameworks such as UN Global Compact and OECD Guidelines for Multinationals,” Huber says. “We try to be as transparent as possible in regards to what we expect from our investees. The policy is constantly being developed further in order to refine our expectations and have more fruitful discussions with our investee companies in relation to all aspects of E, S and G. “DWS doesn’t differentiate between active and passive investments. Our corporate governance policy applies to all in the same manner”. “In general, we are looking for a constructive dialogue with our investee companies. As a further escalation step, when companies do not move into the desired direction, voting against management proposals and participation at annual general meetings are an important way to articulate our concerns. In this, we are able to raise questions, concerns or where appropriate we also commend boards on certain successes. Highlighting issues in public is an important way to define our position which hopefully puts pressure on companies to act. Last year, we submitted questions to 40 AGMs, publicly making clear what our expectations were of the companies concerned.” DWS is the brand name of DWS Group GmbH & Co.

But he thinks voters in the old Red Wall have grown weary of Labour councils continually blaming Conservative fiscal policy for the problems they face. “For a period of time saying austerity was killing us was fair but over [12 years] the public gets tone deaf to it and understandably so,” he said. “People just want to see services being delivered. So, if you’ve spent too long saying ‘austerity austerity austerity’, people are going to turn away from you. We need to get on with being positive. Explain why there may be a reduction in services - why we’re cutting the grass less or there’s more pot holes - but tell people what we’re doing to make things better.” He added: “Sunderland has lost more than £350 million – it’s almost impossible to live with – but what have to do is deliver either more with the same or the same with less.” He spoke out as fears emerged that the party might lose control of the north-east city’s council for the first time since it was formed in 197. Internal Conservative polling is said to suggest the reds could lose six seats here on 5 May, denying the party its historic majority on Wearside. The loss – should it happen – would follow a devastating set of local election results last year in which the party saw more than 320 councillors voted out, including nine in Sunderland. Majority control of one-time redoubts including Sheffield and Northumberland was also surrendered on a horror night for the party. Now, although Councillor Miller says he is confident Labour will retain Sunderland Council and make gains across the north, he admitted many voters appeared to feel the party had taken them for granted for too long. “We have to work hard to gain the trust of people again by doing,” said the 59-year-old, whose own seat is also up for re-election this year. “And if we’re honest, that probably explains why we’ve lost support in places like Darlington, Hartlepool, Stockton, Middlesborough – because these are big Labour areas that we should be strong in, and we need to work out how we get back there.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(526, '/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-fresh-partygate-fines-b2063609.html', 1, 'independent', 'Partygate fines issued over lockdown event Boris Johnson attended', 'At least two Downing Street staffers have received police fines for attending a ‘bring your own booze’ event on 20 May 2020, sources told The Independent. This is the second event that the prime minister is known to have attended at which revellers have been given fixed penalty notices. In January, Boris Johnson admitted he attended the event which took place when the nation was in lockdown, however he claimed he believed it was a work event. Mr Johnson’s principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, is said to have invited up to 100 people to the “socially distanced” evening drinks. Boris Johnson is under more pressure following the news of further Downing Street Covid fines It was reported that 30-40 people turned up, including the prime minister’s wife Carrie. No 10 has denied Mr Johnson has received another fixed penality notice for the garden party on 20 May. The revelations come after the Metropolitan Police announced it would not issues any further updates on Partygate fines until after May’s local elections. The decision has drawn some criticism, with a human rights barrister saying that withholding information could influence the vote. Downing Street has indicated it will still say whether the prime minister, who was already handed one fixed-penalty notice by police over a birthday event in 2020, receives further fines, despite Scotland Yard’s pause on announcements. A Met spokesperson said: “While the investigation will continue during the pre-election period, due to the restrictions around communicating before the May local elections, we will not provide further updates until after 5 May.” Scotland Yard is carrying out an investigation into alleged lockdown-breaching parties at No 10  But Adam Wagner, an expert on Covid-19 regulations, who has been involved in a legal challenge to the Met’s initial refusal to investigate lockdown-busting Downing Street parties, questioned whether the police should observe pre-election period rules which typically place limits on government publicity around elections. The latest tranche of Covid fines will heap more pressure on Boris Johnson, who has been told this week that a no-confidence vote is “inevitable”. Senior Tory MP Tobias Ellwood said a ballot on the prime minister’s future was a matter of “when, not if”, as he urged fellow backbenchers to stop “drinking the Kool-Aid”, and force a change of leadership. Former minister Tobias Ellwood has been vocal of waning support for Boris Johnson Tory peer Lord Hayward, the party’s influential polling expert, predicted a no-confidence vote within months following a “dramatic” shift in support since the PM was fined over his law-breaking birthday bash. “The mood has turned against the prime minister,” Lord Hayward told the BBC after speaking to Tory colleagues at Westminster. “Support for the prime minister has fallen quite markedly ... I expect there to be a challenge to his leadership.” Sir John Curtice told The Independent that Partygate is set to be a major problem for the Tories at the May local elections – saying that the party’s polling had got worse since the PM was fined by the Metropolitan Police.

(528, '/news/uk/politics/eu-standard-charge-usb-c-parliament-b2063529.html', 1, 'independent', 'EU parliament votes to mandate one standard charger for all phones', 'An EU plan to force phone manufacturers to use one common standard charger has moved a step closer after it was approved by the European Parliament this week.  The European Union hopes that mandating USB-C ports on all smartphones will cut waste, make devices more interoperable, and promote consumer competition.  MEPs on the parliament’s influential Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection adopted the position on Wednesday by 43 votes in favour and two against, with support from the parliament’s main political groups. They also voted to push the European Commission to adopt a common interoperability standard on wireless charging, which is increasingly common on new devices but has several competing technologies.  If enforced, as now looks likely, the common charger regulation would see companies like Apple made to ditch its proprietary “lightning” cable and adopt the industry standard.  The rule is also expected to apply to tablets, handheld games consoles, e-readers, digital cameras, and other portable devices like laptops. While the regulation would technically only apply inside the European Union, the bloc’s influential economic position means the change will likely have a global effect as companies reconfigure their products so they can be sold in the European market.  The EU’s Council, which represents member states, already approved a similar plan for a standard charger in January this year, and the two institutions will now hash out exactly what the final regulation looks like and when it will come into force.  The parliament’s 705 MEPs must also formally approve the committee’s plan at a full plenary session next month, though this is largely a formality as the committee vote indicates strong support from across the different political groups. The EU’s elected legislature has been pushing for a common charger to be adopted for around a decade, but the bloc’s long legislative process has been slow-going on the issue. Critics have argued that regulating the ports could stifle innovation.

(529, '/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-parties-tory-leadership-vote-b2063501.html', 1, 'independent', 'PM warned no-confidence vote now inevitable, as ‘mood turns’', 'Boris Johnson has been warned by senior Conservatives that a no-confidence vote is now inevitable over the Partygate scandal, with one warning that the mood had “turned against him”. Senior Tory MP Tobias Ellwood said a ballot on the prime minister’s future was a matter of “when, not if”, as he urged fellow backbenchers to stop “drinking the Kool-Aid” and force a change of leadership. Tory peer Lord Hayward, the party’s influential polling expert, predicted a no-confidence vote within months following a “dramatic” shift in support since the PM was fined over his law-breaking birthday bash. “The mood has turned against the prime minister,” Lord Hayward told the BBC after speaking to Tory colleagues at Westminster. “Support for the prime minister has fallen quite markedly ... I expect there to be a challenge to his leadership.” Sir John Curtice told The Independent that Partygate is set to be a major problem for the Tories at the May local elections – saying that the party’s polling had got worse since the PM was fined by the Metropolitan Police. “The story is not going to go away, the story has now got legs again,” the polling guru said. “The opposition is just going to keep on talking about it. All of this plays to Keir Starmer’s advantage.” Professor Curtice said Labour had stretched its lead over the Tories by three points since Mr Johnson was handed a fixed penalty notice – leading to an average Labour poll lead of eight points. It comes as the leader of the Tories in Sunderland said Mr Johnson had become an “embarrassment” to the party. Dr Antony Mullen said a new leader was “inevitable”, adding: “You can’t have a prime minister who breaks the law.” There were reports on Friday evening that Met has issued new fines over the party held in the No 10 garden on 20 May 2020, an event attended by Mr Johnson. Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said Mr Johnson “must immediately declare if he has been given another fine”. Downing Street has not yet commented on the reports, but has previously said it would reveal if Mr Johnson received more fines after Scotland Yard said it would not be issuing any more public updates before the 5 May elections. Some 54 letters of no-confidence have to be sent to the chair of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers to trigger a vote. A majority of the party’s MPs – around 180 – must vote against Mr Johnson to remove him from office. Former Tory chief whip Mark Harper – who has called for Mr Johnson to step down – has predicted a no-confidence will be triggered before parliament’s summer recess in July. Mr Ellwood also suggested on Friday that the threshold would be reached in the coming months. “We’re going to see a steady trickle of letters, resignations,” he told Sky News. “More and more MPs are privately believing that it’s the time that the leadership baton is actually passed on.” Lord Hayward said Tory MPs, peers and local associations fear “death by a thousand cuts”, since the Partygate saga looks set to dog the PM through more police fines, the release of the full Sue Gray report and the privileges committee probe. “They are moving to a position of saying, ‘This cannot go on’,” the peer told BBC’s World at One. He said many in the party now want the question of the PM’s leadership “resolved” in the next few months. Lord Barwell, former chief of staff to Theresa May, said Brexiteer MP Steve Baker’s call for Mr Johnson to go this week was significant. “If I was still working in No 10, I would be pretty worried about that intervention.” However, loyal allies of Mr Johnson lashed out at Tory MPs calling for his removal. Northern Ireland minister Conor Burns said there is “no question” of the PM stepping down and said backbench critics had “never really supported” him. The loyal ally told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “If the prime minister stepped off Westminster Bridge and walked on top of the water they would say he couldn’t swim – that is a fact.” Sharing Mr Johnson’s “frustration” with the new Commons inquiry, Mr Burns complained: “This is going to be the most looked at event, possibly, since the Second World War.” Mr Johnson said on Friday that the public cared more about getting a free trade deal with India than Partygate. Asked in New Delhi if he will still be PM by Diwali in October, he replied: “Yes.” Defence minister Leo Docherty even claimed on Friday that Partygate was “done and dusted”, claiming that the British public was now “sick of it”. Speaking at the Invictus Games in The Hague, the minister said: “It’s pretty much done and dusted in the sense that the prime minister’s apologised for the fixed penalty notice he received. In my opinion I regard that as matter closed.” Prof Curtice said public anger about Partygate was now “baked in” to opinion polling, and the widespread perception that Mr Johnson had lied about the issue would be very difficult to shift. He said: “I think we’ve reached a point where the opposition probably thinks that Boris Johnson staying on is to their advantage. The Labour message is the ‘Tories want to hang onto a lawbreaker’. And they will keep on repeating it.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

Jacob Rees-Mogg on Wednesday told a committee of MPs that it was \"nonsense\" that the UK had to stick to the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol, which the government negotiated and ratified as part of exiting the European Union. On Friday a a spokesperson for the EU\'s executive hit back and told reporters in Brussels on Friday that \"the withdrawal agreement, the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, are legal obligations to which the UK is bound\". Mr Rees-Mogg, who is Boris Johnson\'s minister for Brexit opportunities, had told a hearing of parliament\'s EU scrutiny committee: \"A lot of commentary that says: ‘Well, we signed it and therefore surely we should accept it lock, stock and barrel.’ That’s absolute nonsense. “We signed it on the basis that it would be reformed. And there comes a point at which you say: ‘Well, you haven’t reformed it and therefore we are reforming it ourselves.’ And the United Kingdom is much more important than any agreement that we have with any foreign power.\" On Friday morning the Financial Times additionally reported that Boris Johnson is preparing to bring forward laws override parts of the Brexit agreement in UK statue.  The powers are expected to be included in the Queen\'s Speech next month and would likely spark a new political conflict with Brussels. Some unionists are annoyed that the protocol imposes frictions on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland though polls show the agreement generally has popular support there. Asked about the reports, a European Commission spokesperson told reporters in Brussels: \"It will come as absolutely no surprise to that we have no comment on press reports or unnamed sources, or other comments. I think more generally, I can simply reiterate what we have said a number of times in this press room: that we are fully committed to working jointly with the UK government to find long-lasting solutions for Northern Ireland, to bring about long-lasting certainty and predictability for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.  \"Only joint solutions can do that: jointly-agreed solutions. And if you look at it, this approach is working. Only a couple of days ago we reached the solution on medicines for Northern Ireland which was agreed in record time. It\'s important to underline that. \"As you know, last October, we came forward with a number of serious, wide-ranging solutions for Northern Ireland. We\'ve been working on them since and our intention is to continue working on these solutions with the UK over the coming weeks. I think finally, it\'s important to to underline as well that our agreements, the withdrawal agreement, the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, are legal obligations to which the UK is bound as much as we are.\" Reuters PA PA PA AFP/Getty PA PA PA Getty PA PA AFP via Getty PA AFP/Getty PA PA PA PA AFP/Getty PA Reuters PA AP SWNS PA Getty PA PA PA PA AFP/Getty AFP/Getty PA PA PA PA AFP/Getty PA PA PA PA PA PA PA AFP via Getty Images UK PARLIAMENT/AFP via Getty Images PA PA AP PA The spokesperson added that EU and UK teams had been in regular contact on the issue at both a technical and political level. Under the Northern Ireland Brexit protocol, Northern Ireland remains in the EU single market and customs area – a provision agreed by both sides to prevent a hard border from being required between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Both sides wanted to achieve this aim to preserve the Good Friday Agreement and peace process. But the agreement means there are some checks on trade and extra frictions between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, because the government wanted to take Britain out of the customs union and single market under its hard Brexit policy. Recent polling from October 2021 conducted by LucidTalk to Queen’s University Belfast revealed 52 per cent of respondents believe the post-Brexit arrangement to be a “good thing”, up from 43 per cent in June that year. Asked whether the UK would be justified in triggering Article 16 53 per cent of respondents said no and 39 per cent who responded yes.

Internal polling is said to suggest the blues could win enough seats at May’s local elections to deny Labour a majority on the authority for the first time since it was formed in 1974. Such a loss of a flagship council would be seen as a massive blow to both the Labour Party’s prestige and to Sir Keir Starmer’s leadership. But Dr Antony Mullen – who has led the Conservatives in the city since 2020 – said convincing residents to give him their vote had been made harder by having a prime minister now known to have broken coronavirus lockdown laws.  Dr Mullen is an academic by profession who’s also up for re-election this time round in his Barnes ward, where he lives. “It’s not coming up on the doorstep as much as you might think,” he said.  “I think it’s one of those things where if you didn’t like him [Mr Johnson] before, then this is something else to utilise against him, and if you did like him before, it was kind of assumed this is the person he is – an unorthodox politician.  “But that’s not to downplay the anger some people are feeling. It’s there. And I agree with it. And it will, inevitably, lose some votes.” It comes after the 30-year-old called on the PM to resign in January as the ongoing partygate revelations snowballed. He said he stood by that demand. “I think it’s inevitable,” he said. “Probably after the Ukraine crisis or at the latest by Christmas. You can’t have a prime minister who breaks the law.” Asked if he was embarrassed by the PM’s actions, he said: “I’m not personally because I’ve made it clear what my views are: I’m not a fan of him. I didn’t vote for him in the leadership contest. I voted for Jeremy Hunt as an Anti-Boris vote. But is it embarrassing for the party? Yes, I can’t see how it couldn’t be.” Sunderland Council itself is currently led by Labour’s Graeme Miller who has a six-seat majority – and says he is not worried about losing it. But if it is lost on 5 May when some 25 positions are up for grabs, it would open up the possibility of a Tory and Lib Dem coalition taking control of the authority in what is perhaps the reddest part of the old Red Wall. “People will vote on local issues rather than on Partygate,” said Dr Mullen. “And we feel that’s where we’re making traction.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(532, '/asia/india/boris-gujarat-visit-slums-white-cloth-b2063148.html', 1, 'independent', 'Indian slums ‘covered up with white cloth’ during Johnson’s visit', 'Large white sheets appear to have been used to cover up the view of slum housing along the route taken by Boris Johnson during his visit to Gujarat, India, on Thursday. A number of videos and images posted on social media by local journalists appear to show white sheets lining the roadside near the former home of Mahatma Gandhi in Ahmedabad, which was visited by the UK prime minister on the first day of his India tour. Later that day other images showed the sheets being taken down from their large metal frames, once again revealing the view of slum housing behind.  There is no official confirmation that the Gujarat government, led by prime minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), made these arrangements for Mr Johnson’s visit, and both state and city officials The Independent spoke to said they were not aware of any plan to obscure the view of slums. One video, shared online by filmmaker Vinod Kapri and purportedly recorded on Thursday in Ahmedabad, shows white cloth blocking the view on the side of the road as normal traffic continues in the busy city. Addressing Mr Modi, who hails from Gujarat and has increasingly offered the state as a stopover for visiting foreign dignitaries in recent years, Kapri wrote: “You were the chief minister of Gujarat for 12 years. For 8 years you are the prime minister of the country @narendramodi. Still, what is it that you are ashamed to show @BorisJohnson ?”  One later video, posted on Thursday evening by a journalist named Umashankar Singh who works with news channel NDTV, shows the white sheets being taken down from their scaffolding, revealing shacks and parked scooters behind. “Curtains come off as Johnson leaves,” he wrote on Twitter on Thursday after the prime minister had left for Delhi for his talks with Mr Modi on Friday.  Mr Johnson had landed in India’s western province of Gujarat at 10.30am local time on Thursday and was received by chief minister Bhupendra Patel. His itinerary in Ahmedabad included the visit to the famous Sabarmati Ashram, the old home of Mahatma Gandhi, where he posed sitting with Gandhi’s famous charkha (spinning wheel).  In his opening remarks to Mr Modi during his ceremonial reception in Delhi on Friday morning, Mr Johnson commented on how much he had enjoyed the “fantastic welcome” in Gujarat and said he “wouldn’t necessarily get that ... everywhere in the world”.  Mr Johnson’s visit to India came amid calls for his resignation back home, after he was fined by the police for breaching his own Covid lockdown rules.  This isn’t the first time steps have been taken to block slums from view during a visit by a foreign dignitary to Ahmedabad. When then-US president Donald Trump visited Gujarat in early 2020 for a stadium event alongside Mr Modi dubbed the “Namaste Trump” rally, Ahmedabad’s municipal corporation built a four-foot-high wall to obscure a stretch of slums on the American leader’s route through the city.  Mr Johnson’s own India visit had already been mired in controversy after he visited a JCB factory, one day after the same company’s equipment was used to demolish houses of mostly poor Muslims in the North Delhi locality of Jahangirpur, an area that has seen back-to-back incidents of religious violence over the last weekend.

(534, '/news/uk/politics/facebook-ap-european-parliament-big-tech-london-b2063444.html', 1, 'independent', 'EU poised to unveil rules forcing Big Tech to protect users', ' The European Union is nearing agreement on a set of new rules aimed at protecting internet users by forcing big tech companies like Google and Facebook to step up their efforts to curb the spread of illegal content, hate speech and disinformation.  EU officials were negotiating Friday over the final details of the legislation, dubbed the Digital Services Act. It\'s part of a sweeping overhaul of the 27-nation bloc\'s digital rulebook, highlighting the EU\'s position at the forefront of the global movement to rein in the power of online platforms and social media companies. While the rules still need to be approved by the European Parliament and European Council that represents the 27 member countries, the bloc is far ahead of the United States and other countries in drawing up regulations for tech giants to force them to protect people from harmful content that proliferates online. Negotiators from the EU\'s executive Commission, member countries and France, which holds the rotating EU presidency, were working to hammer out a deal before the end of Friday, ahead of French elections Sunday.  The new rules, which are designed to protect internet users and their “fundamental rights online,\" would make tech companies more accountable for content on their platforms. Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter would have to beef up mechanisms to flag and remove illegal content like hate speech, while online marketplaces like Amazon would have to do the same for dodgy products like counterfeit sneakers or unsafe toys. These systems will be standardized so that they will work the same way on any online platform.  That means “any national authority will be able to request that illegal content is removed, regardless of where the platform is established in Europe,” the EU\'s single market commissioner, Thierry Breton, said on Twitter.  Companies that breach the rules face fines amounting to as much as 6% of their annual global revenue, which for tech giants would mean billions of dollars. Repeat offenders could be banned from the EU market.  Google and Twitter declined to comment. Amazon and Facebook didn’t respond to requests for comment.  The Digital Services Act also includes measures to better protect children by banning advertising targeted at minors. Online ads targeted to users based on their gender, ethnicity and sexual orientation would be prohibited.  There also would be a ban on so-called dark patterns — deceptive techniques to nudge users into doing things they didn’t intend to.  Tech companies would have to carry out regular risk assessments on illegal content, disinformation and other harmful information and then report back on whether they\'re doing enough to tackle the problem. They will have to be more transparent and provide information to regulators and independent researchers on content moderation efforts. This could mean, for example, making YouTube turn over data on whether its recommendation algorithm has been directing users to more Russian propaganda than normal. To enforce the new rules, the European Commission is expected to hire more than 200 new staffers. To pay for it, tech companies will be charged a “supervisory fee,\" which could be up to 0.1% of their annual global net income, depending on the negotiations.  The EU reached a similar political agreement last month on its Digital Markets Act, a separate piece of legislation aimed at reining in the power of tech giants and making them treat smaller rivals fairly.  Meanwhile, Britain has drafted its own online safety legislation that includes prison sentences for senior executives at tech companies who fail to comply.

(562, '/sport/football/jesse-marsch-leeds-marcelo-bielsa-american-premier-b2063846.html', 2, 'independent', 'Marsch stresses respect for Bielsa after ‘over-training’ comment', 'Jesse Marsch insists he has “major respect” for Marcelo Bielsa after comments the American made in a recent radio interview. Bielsa was controversially sacked by Leeds United at the end of February after a poor run of results and replaced by Marsch, who was tasked with keeping the club in the Premier League. During an interview on talkSPORT last week, Marsch said Leeds’ players had been over-trained under Bielsa and that had led to a debilitating injury list which has undermined their season. Some Leeds fans claimed those comments were disrespectful of Bielsa and Marsch wanted to set the record straight at a media conference before Monday’s Premier League game at Crystal Palace. Unprompted, Marsch said: “I haven’t spoken at all since the comments I made on talkSPORT about overtraining and Marcelo and listen, I want to say this was not intentional to attack Marcelo in any way. “It was a little bit careless and I can see how it was interpreted in some ways. “But it was more about the state of the player pool and what I had observed in trying to take the team forward. “I think you would be hard-pressed to find an incoming coach that has spoken more positively about the person he replaced (than) the way I have spoken about Marcelo. It’s because I have major respect for him. “I haven’t said anything about what I said after that and I’ve seen a little bit of the response, but I want to make sure that the respect for Marcelo is of a very high level from me and from everyone here.” Leeds have struggled without several key players for long periods in their second season back in the top flight. Patrick Bamford is still struggling with a foot problem, while Kalvin Phillips and skipper Liam Cooper have only recently returned from long-term hamstring injuries. Marsch had said in his talkSPORT interview: “The injury issue, for me, had a lot to do with the training methodology. “These players were over-trained and it led to them being physically, mentally, emotionally and psychologically in a difficult place to recover from week to week, game to game. “You could see it in their faces. You could see in the 15th minute that some of them were already at the max – and that shouldn’t be the case.” Despite taking 10 points from a possible 12 in their last four matches, Leeds remain under pressure heading into Monday’s trip to Selhurst Park. They sit five points above the relegation zone with six games to play and Marsch added: “The only thing for us to do is to just focus on us and making sure that we have a performance that gives us a chance to get the three points. “I mean, it depends on every result really, so I don’t really care about anyone else.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(563, '/sport/football/emmanuel-macron-patrick-vieira-crystal-palace-premier-league-france-b2063845.html', 2, 'independent', 'Vieira hopeful Palace will enjoy more ups than downs in run-in', 'Crystal Palace boss Patrick Vieira is hopeful his side will enjoy more ups than downs during the final six matches of the season. It has been an impressive debut campaign for the former Arsenal captain at Selhurst Park, keeping the club comfortably away from the Premier League relegation zone and leading them to the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley last weekend. Sunday’s defeat to Chelsea ended their hopes of silverware and has been sandwiched in between league losses to Leicester and Newcastle which will make a top-half finish a challenge. Vieira’s side were on a seven-match unbeaten run recently and he is well aware of the up and down nature of the English top flight. “This is the Premier League,” he said ahead of Monday’s visit of Leeds. “It’s about trying to be consistent with the performances and the results of course. “We had some ups and downs during the season but we always managed to bounce back and to find a way to play better and to win games. “Lately, yes the results are not what we expected but when we look at the performances, we had some really good periods in the games but it wasn’t good enough. “We have to play better, we have to play more together as a team for 95 minutes to allow ourselves more chances to win games.” Palace do not play this weekend and instead are in action on Monday, which allows Vieira time to make a decision ahead of Sunday’s French presidential vote. Current President Emmanuel Macron, who is a centrist, is in the running against far-right nationalist rival Marine Le Pen. Vieira was under no doubt about who should win, adding: “It’s a really important day for France and for the country. “Hopefully everybody will vote for Emmanuel Macron and that will be a good day for France.” After defeat at Newcastle on Wednesday, Vieira’s spirits were lifted a day later when he attended an event where he was officially honoured into the Premier League’s Hall of Fame. It was announced last month the former Arsenal captain would be recognised by England’s top division. “Yeah, it felt good. It was a lovely evening, seeing the players around, taking a look back at my career and what I achieved, it was a proud moment surrounded by my family,” Vieira said. “It was good to be recognised as one of the players who had an impact in the Premier League.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(564, '/sport/football/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-champions-league-europa-conference-league-premier-league-b206', 2, 'independent', 'Klopp feared Liverpool may end up in Europa Conference League', 'Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp admits there were times last season when he feared having to play in the Europa Conference League. Sunday’s visit of Everton for the 240th Merseyside derby is the one-year anniversary of a 1-1 draw at home to Newcastle which put their Premier League top-four hopes in serious danger. They went on to win their remaining five matches and comfortably finish third as the likes of Chelsea and Leicester faded and since that draw with Newcastle they have dropped only 20 points from a possible 111. It has seen them win the League Cup, reach the FA Cup final, Champions League semi-final and sit one point behind Manchester City in the title race. “What we did last year, what the boys did last year, was very special in such a difficult situation,” he said. “To get qualified for the Champions League was massive. There were a lot of moments before the Newcastle game – I didn’t know that was one year ago – where I thought, ‘Ah that’s difficult and we will not make that this year’. “We had moments where we thought, ‘OK, hopefully we don’t have to play Conference League.’ That’s how it is because it’s, ‘OK, when does that start?’ and then you have to readjust the pre-season planning and all these kind of things. “I remember these thoughts. And then the boys won five games in a spectacular manner – West Brom, Ali’s (goalkeeper Alison Becker) header, all these kind of things. Outstanding, I loved each bit of it.” After their struggles in defending their title last season, severely impacted by losing three first-choice defenders, many pundits did not have Liverpool down to be contenders this season. But already this campaign has exceeded expectations, although Klopp insists he did not have specific targets in mind when it began. “I didn’t expect us to win the Carabao Cup, be in an FA Cup final, semi-final of the Champions League and one point behind the leader of the table,” he added. “I didn’t think about that, to be honest, but I knew we will be better. We had moments where we thought, \'OK, hopefully we don’t have to play Conference League.\' That\'s how it is because it\'s, \'OK, when does that start?\' and then you have to readjust the pre-season planning and all these kind of things “But saying that, we knew in the moment when we can bring Ibou (summer signing Ibrahima Konate) and when the other three boys (Virgil Van Dijk, Joe Gomez and Joel Matip) are back, we will be stronger, that’s clear. “When you are third and will be stronger and had a bad year for different reasons, it is a normal human reaction that you intensify pretty much all efforts. “That’s what we did but then we had an absolutely OK first part of the season, but it was not that people were over the moon when you are 14 points behind the leader (in January) and probably a lot of other teams in between us and them. “But again, what the boys made of that was pretty special so far. We knew we will be better but that we will be in this position, I had no idea about.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(570, '/sport/boxing/tyson-fury-whyte-fight-attendance-crowd-b2063171.html', 3, 'independent', 'How many fans are at Fury vs Whyte?', 'Tyson Fury and Dillian Whyte will finally settle their rivalry this Saturday when they go head-to-head in a heavyweight title fight at Wembley Stadium. One of the biggest all-British fights in heavyweight history, the main-event contest pits WBC champion Fury against challenger Whyte, who is looking to hand his compatriot the first loss of his professional career. While Fury has set out to antagonise his former sparring partner all throughout the build-up to the bout in the English capital, Whyte has largely elected to stay silent. The 34-year-old finally spoke out this week, however, saying: “[Fury] can’t get in my head. Even if he gets in my head, he’s only gonna find a lot of disturbance in there.” Here’s all you need to know about the fight. When is it? The fight will take place on Saturday 23 April. The first fight will begin at 6pm BST, with coverage starting from 7pm. The ring walks for the main event are expected to take place at 9.45pm BST. Tyson Fury will put his WBC title on the line (John Walton/PA) Where will it take place? The fight will take place at Wembley Stadium in London, marking Fury’s first contest on home soil since 2018. Around 94,000 fans are expected to fill the venue. How can I watch it? In the UK, the event will air exclusively on BT Sport Box Office at a cost of £24.95. In the US, ESPN+ will stream the action live at a cost of $69.99 What are the odds? Tyson Fury – 1/7 Dillian Whyte – 4/1 Draw – 25/1 Via Betfair. How much will the fighters earn? Fury’s promoter Frank Warren won the purse bid with his effort of approximately £30million, which beat the £23m put forward by Whyte’s promoter Eddie Hearn. Both were record bids in the history of boxing. An 80/20 per cent purse split was agreed in favour of champion Fury, though the split only relates to 90 per cent of the overall winning bid (£27m) – because the promoter must deposit the other 10 per cent. As such, Fury will thus take home approximately £21.5m, while Whyte receives around £5.5m. The winner will receive the 10 per cent deposit (£3m). What are the fighters’ records? Fury, 33, is unbeaten at 31-0-1 (22 knockouts), with a controversial split draw in his first fight with Deontay Wilder giving way to stoppage wins against the American in the “Gypsy King”’s two most recent bouts.

(571, '/sport/boxing/tyson-fury-dillian-whyte-fight-b2063714.html', 3, 'independent', '‘I’m not untouchable’ admits Fury ahead of Whyte fight', 'Tyson Fury insisted he is not “untouchable” as he prepares to shake off a fight week free of animosity and go to “war” against Dillian Whyte at Wembley Stadium on Saturday night. Fury weighed 18st 12lbs 13oz on the eve of his WBC heavyweight title defence, nearly a stone lighter than six months ago when he knocked out Deontay Wilder in a thrilling third fight between the pair. Speculation has persisted throughout the build-up that Fury may look to keep the fight at a distance and frustrate Whyte, but the self-styled ‘Gypsy King’ was adamant his defence is not impregnable. While he has beaten everyone he has faced, Fury was downed four times in his trilogy against Wilder and also had to rise from the canvas to beat Neven Pajkic in 2011 and Steve Cunningham two years later. “I’m not sure about all this outboxing – unless I’m Houdini, I can definitely hit them all, for sure, but I’ve definitely been hit before,” said Fury, who has won 31 and drawn one of his 32 fights. “I’ve been bounced off the canvas more times than a bouncy ball. I’m not this untouchable boxer everyone thinks I might be. I’m just a normal boxing man who has got lucky 32 times in a row, I think!” Fury and Whyte were training partners on several occasions earlier in their careers and there have been conflicting accounts between the duo on social media at what happened during their sparring sessions. When they have been together this week, though, there has been a surprising lack of friction, with the bonhomie continuing at Friday’s weigh-in, where Whyte (28-2, 19KOs) scaled 18st 1lb 4oz. “(Whyte is) a decent bloke,” added Fury. “He’s got some morals and we got along like a house on fire in training camps. “He’s definitely a fearless guy, I’ve sparred him a lot in the past and he didn’t show any weaknesses at all. I’m not going to sit here and slate the fella because I’ve not got anything to slate him on.” Fury, 33, and Whyte, 34, were in a playful spirits at the final stare down. The 6ft 9in Fury emphasised his five-inch height advantage by standing on his tiptoes at BOXPARK Wembley and Whyte played along by crouching down, with the pair shaking hands, trading baseball caps and sharing wide grins. They then briefly danced on stage alongside one another but Fury, who has repeatedly suggested he will retire whatever the outcome this weekend, was clear the mood will be different when they next meet. Don\'t doubt us, we\'re going to put a show on like no other before “We’re going to give you a real fight,” said Fury. “Don’t doubt us, we’re going to put a show on like no other before. It’s going to be a war, don’t worry about that.” This will be Fury’s first fight on UK soil since August 2018, with his last five bouts in the United States, and it is expected to attract an estimated 94,000 spectators – a post-war British record. If he does follow through with his plan to hang up his gloves then he is spurning the chance to face either Oleksandr Usyk – the current WBA, IBF and WBO champion, titles all previously held by Fury after he beat Wladimir Klitschko in 2015 – or another domestic rival in Anthony Joshua. “I’m not interested,” added Fury. “There’s no belts that I haven’t already won or already got that would bring me back.” While Fury was more aggressive in beating Wilder for the WBC title in February 2020 and then again in October last year, Whyte has been unimpressed by his fellow Briton’s more usual fighting style. “Fury’s style is boring,” said Whyte. “Now he’s a bit more exciting and in his last few fights he was able to stand and trade with Wilder. “Wilder is dangerous but not that good, so Fury could stay in the pocket and outwork him and outhustle him, because Wilder didn’t do anything up close apart from throw that big right hand from range. “People have been saying ‘Tyson Fury, he’s exciting’. No he’s not, he beat up Deontay Wilder three times. Three years prior, no one cared about Tyson Fury fights. The fights were boring.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(572, '/sport/boxing/lennox-lewis-tyson-fury-dillian-whyte-b2063708.html', 3, 'independent', 'Lewis doesn’t believe Fury will retire after Whyte fight', 'Lennox Lewis suspects Tyson Fury will only walk away from boxing once he has cemented himself as the number one heavyweight of his era – by beating Oleksandr Usyk and Anthony Joshua. Fury (31-0-1, 22KOs) has repeatedly suggested he will retire after his WBC heavyweight title defence against Dillian Whyte in an all-British affair in front of around 94,000 spectators at Wembley Stadium on Saturday. If Fury follows through with his plan then fights many have been clamouring for against the unbeaten Ukrainian Usyk, who holds the WBA, IBF and WBO crowns, and another UK rival in Joshua would not occur. Lewis, the last heavyweight to be recognised as undisputed champion, pointed out he would not have felt able to end his own celebrated career had he not fought and beaten the feared Mike Tyson in June 2002. While agreeing Fury is currently the world’s best heavyweight, Lewis believes the ‘Gypsy King’ will only be able to hang up his gloves once he has proven himself against his biggest contemporary rivals. “You look at the guys who are out there,” Lewis told the PA news agency. “Can he beat them? He probably can. He is the top heavyweight in the world right now. “Does he want to beat them? It’s really up to him. I’ve heard him saying he wants to retire. I don’t know whether he’s saying that for real or not but it’ll be sad if he doesn’t fight Usyk. “I didn’t know if the Mike Tyson fight was ever going to happen but I knew I wanted it to happen because I didn’t want anybody saying ‘Tyson would have beaten you’. Now they can’t say that, they have to say ‘you’re the best, you beat Tyson’.” Lewis expects an intriguing “barn buster” of a fight in Saturday’s headliner, tipping either the taller, rangier and more elusive Fury to prevail on points or Whyte to cause an upset by knockout. Lewis has been encouraged by the recent performances of Whyte (28-2, 19KOs), particularly how the Londoner avenged his defeat to Alexander Povetkin 13 months ago. “I know Dillian Whyte’s ready; he’s strong, he throws a great hook, great jab,” Lewis said. “I’ve seen him improving over his last few fights so this is the main fight he has to be ready for. “He really needs to step on the gears and really go after him and hit what he can hit. It’s going to be hard to box against a 6ft 9in guy. “I boxed against a 6ft 9in guy and I know how hard it is to hit them. It takes a few rounds to get acclimatised and I think it’ll take Dillian a few rounds to get acclimatised with Tyson Fury as well.” Lewis – who beat everyone he fought in a professional career that yielded 41 wins, two defeats and a draw – retired in 2003 but admitted a contest against Fury is one he would have relished in his prime. “If I was boxing Tyson, what would I do to win?” Lewis added. “I would jab him first and then knock him with my right hand, and then give him the wake-up punch where you hit him and he goes ‘who’s that?’ “He’s a great guy, a great personality. He gives you a great fight and then he sings afterwards, it’s incredible. “It would have been great to fight him in my era and it would have been an absolutely great fight.” :: BT Sport Box Office will show Fury v Whyte exclusively live on Saturday April 23 from 6pm.

(573, '/sport/boxing/tyson-fury-next-fight-opponent-b2063173.html', 3, 'independent', 'Who is Fury fighting next?', 'Tyson Fury will defend the WBC heavyweight title for the second time this weekend, as the Briton takes on compatriot Dillian Whyte at Wembley Stadium. Fury won the belt from Deontay Wilder in February 2020, stopping the American in the seventh round after their controversial split draw in December 2018. While most observers felt that Fury, 33, had done enough to beat Wilder in their initial clash, the “Gypsy King” left no doubt in their rematch. Still, Wilder was contractually owed a trilogy bout, and so the rivals went head to head one last time in October 2021. Once again Fury secured a finish, knocking out the “Bronze Bomber” in the 11th round after twice climbing off the canvas himself – as he had done in the pair’s first in-ring meeting. That fight last October marked Fury’s first defence of the WBC heavyweight title, and now he takes on mandatory challenger and interim champion Whyte in a main-event contest in front of more than 90,000 fans in London. While Fury has suggested that he will retire after fighting Whyte, most fans and pundits are sceptical. Should Fury lose to Whyte (28-2, 19 knockouts), a result that most would deem a major upset, the Britons would almost certainly face off for a second time. However, if Fury (31-0-1, 22 KOs) wins, the likelihood is that the 33-year-old will be set for a unification bout. Anthony Joshua (left) and Oleksandr Usyk are set for a heavyweight title rematch (Zac Goodwin/PA) Oleksandr Usyk is the reigning WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO heavyweight champion, having taken the titles from Anthony Joshua in September. The undefeated Ukrainian outpointed the Briton with relative ease at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London, leading “AJ” to quickly trigger a rematch clause. A step-aside deal, which would have seen Usyk face Fury this spring, fell through – reportedly due to Joshua’s monetary demands – before the Ukrainian returned to his home country in March to aid its defence against the Russian invasion. Usyk announced later that month, however, that he would be leaving Ukraine to begin preparing for his rematch with Joshua, which is now expected to take place in June or July – likely in Saudi Arabia. Should Joshua win that contest, a trilogy bout with Usyk is possible, but it seems more probable that the 32-year-old would go on to finally face Fury in the biggest British fight in decades. Last year it seemed that Fury and Joshua were set to contest two fights in 2022, but Wilder’s contractually-owed trilogy bout with Fury scuppered that prospect, as did “AJ”’s loss to Usyk. Still, it remains on the cards if both men can win their upcoming fights against Whyte and Usyk respectively. Fury previously held the WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO belts, dethroning Wladimir Klitschko with a decision win in 2015. The Briton would relinquish the WBA, WBO and IBO titles, however, amid an anti-doping investigation that followed positive tests for cocaine and the prohibited substance nandrolone. Fury was later stripped of the IBF belt. He subsequently took a hiatus from boxing before returning in 2018.

Anticipation is high for what the undefeated Gypsy King claims will be his final contest, with 94,000 tickets sold for the Wembly bout, and even more fans expected to watch via pay-per-view. People in the UK are expected to pay £24.95 via BT Sport Box Office (€29.99 in the Republic of Ireland), while those in the US can catch it on ESPN+ for $69.99. As with previous high-profile fights, the high price to watch the Fury vs Whyte contest could mean that the majority of those tuning in will be doing so through illicit streaming sites. Fury’s last heavyweight title fight against Deontay Wilder saw thousands of free live streams appear online, with technologies like screen-sharing and feed mirroring making it easier than ever for people to seek out and find free streaming sites. Links to free ways to watch high-profile fights are typically shared across social media sites like Facebook and Twitter, as well as in dedicated sub Reddits. Popular piracy sites can also be found through search engines that do not demote them in their search rankings, such as DuckDuckGo. Links to free live streams are expected to proliferate in the hours leading up to the boxing match, though cyber security experts have warned that they could pose a major risk for anyone clicking on them. “Whenever there is a well-publicised event which is predicted to gain a lot of attention, scammers will never be too far away,” Jake Moore, global cyber security adviser at ESET, told The Independent. “Often left to the last few moments before a paid-for TV event, some people may choose to find alternative ways to watch it that circumnavigate any payment. However, this can leave people more out of pocket as cyber criminals prey on those who are looking for such links without carrying out their normal due diligence. “Attempting to watch the fight for free will likely cause people to click on very dodgy links which could do anything from taking control of the computer’s webcam to granting full keyboard access. People often even override antivirus pop-up advice which suggest the user think twice about the links too, especially when time is of the essence.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

Fury defends the WBC belt against fellow Briton Whyte at Wembley Stadium in front of 94,000 fans. And Fury, 33, has offered for Joshua and his promoter Eddie Hearn – who also promotes Whyte – to be among those in attendance. “Yeah, they’re invited, they can be my guests. I’ve got a couple of tickets there,” Fury told iFL TV. “I’ll give one to Eddie out of my ticket allocation and I’ll give two to AJ, because he needs two – the fatness of him these days! I’ll give him a couple of tickets that I’ll pay for, they can come as my personal guests. “AJ, he can help in the corner with me if he wants. I know he don’t like Dillian Whyte, so he can if he wants.” Joshua knocked out Whyte in 2015, avenging an amateur defeat by the “Bodysnatcher”. Fury has suggested that he will retire after fighting Whyte, 34, with fans seemingly set to be deprived of a long-awaited bout between the WBC champion and compatriot Joshua, who previously held the WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO titles on two occasions. Fury, who also held those belts in the past, looked set to box Joshua twice this year under a deal that appeared to have been struck in 2021, but the “Gypsy King” was contractually obliged to fight Deontay Wilder for a third time, and Joshua had to face mandatory challenger Oleksandr Usyk. Anthony Joshua (right) lost his heavyweight belts to Oleksandr Usyk last year (Nick Potts/PA) Fury stopped Wilder for the second fight in a row in October, a month after Usyk outpointed Joshua to take the WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO titles. A step-aside deal was proposed in January, one which would have seen Fury and Usyk fight each other in a unification bout, but that deal reportedly fell through due to Joshua’s monetary demands. “AJ’s had his chance more than once,” Fury said. “He’s had his chance about 10 times to fight me, and for his greed and wanting all the time, it’s not happening. “But it’s no skin off my nose, he ain’t a virgin any more; he’s been beat. “In what world could he have ever beaten me anyway? There’s no debate. It’s not an exciting fight. It’s only for money anyway. “If I fought Joshua now I wouldn’t be gaining anything, because people don’t think he can beat me anyway.” While Fury defends the WBC belt against mandatory challenger Whyte this weekend, Joshua is expected to fight Usyk again in July.

(578, '/sport/boxing/dillian-whyte-tyson-fury-fight-deontay-wilder-b2062240.html', 3, 'independent', 'Whyte can cause chaos against Fury and succeed where Wilder failed', 'There are some sporting moments that the mind cannot project until they have materialised. Across 10 years – 27 fights being the pugilists’ metric in this case – Tyson Fury had danced around, past and through opponents. He had safely navigated his first 16 fights without encountering any significant adversity, and even in his 17th outing when he was knocked down for the first time, Fury was at once back to his feet, disregarding Neven Pajkic’s ferocious haymaker in a manner that seemed to suck all spirit out of the Serb. One round later, Fury had stopped him. Still, the visual now existed: Fury falling, his 6ft 9in frame collapsing to the canvas. It meant that, as many as seven years on, fans could project that image as they anticipated and debated the outcome of Fury’s first clash with Deontay Wilder – the opening salvo in a trilogy that almost made the action and twists of the original Star Wars films seem unambitious and predictable. An image that remained beyond projection, however, was that of Fury not getting back up; not answering the referee’s count. Despite Wilder’s unimpeachable efforts, that image is still just fantasy. It is still fiction. Tyson Fury down during his trilogy fight with Deontay Wilder  In the rivals’ first fight, Fury’s 28th, just one second separated the image from the aperture – on two occasions. It was the case in the ninth round, and it was the case in the 12th. In the first instance, Wilder caught Fury with an overhand right, which looped down from above, and a grazing left hook. There was seemingly a delayed impact, with Fury eventually freezing for a fleeting moment – long enough for Wilder to put him down with the same scraping shot that started the combination. In the 12th round, there was no grazing, no scraping. Again Wilder found his target with a right hand as he punched down on a crouching Fury, and the following left hook was as clean a strike as the American has ever landed – a shot that looked to have pulverised Fury. Again he beat referee Jack Reiss’s count by one. On this occasion, Fury had not taken his time intentionally to gather his senses. On this occasion, his senses had been scattered, his dramatic ascent from the canvas still inexplicable to this day. In the pair’s trilogy bout last October, Fury was again put down twice. In the fourth round, the 33-year-old walked onto a stiff right straight that put him out on his feet. Wilder then only had to touch Fury to put him down. Fury beat Russell Mora’s count by two. Later in the round, a short, clubbing right hook in a semi-clinch landed behind Fury’s ear, and again the champion tumbled to the mat. Again, the “Gypsy King” was fully responsive by the eight-count. And so that image, of a referee waving his hands before Fury’s eyes, remains elusive. It is a major reason why so many fans find it difficult to envision Dillian Whyte conjuring a knockout blow this Saturday. Through 32 fights now, no one has managed it. No one has managed to beat Fury at all. As the 33-year-old has said repeatedly – someone will have to nail him to the canvas. And if the most hellacious hitter in heavyweight history could not do so across three contests, how can Whyte? Dillian Whyte eviscerated Derek Chisora in their 2018 rematch  Well, firstly, Whyte is a better boxer than Wilder. That assertion has drawn some incredulous responses from casual followers of the sport in recent days, but it is far from unfounded. Whyte, 34, may not hit as hard as Wilder – perhaps no one on Earth does – but the Briton is still a powerful puncher. Just ask Alexander Povetkin, Derek Chisora, even Anthony Joshua whom Whyte stopped in an amateur meeting between the rivals. Nineteen of Whyte’s 28 wins have come via knockout, and the “Bodysnatcher” does a far better job at setting up the decisive strike than Wilder does. Whyte, 11 years a professional, has cleaner footwork than Wilder, a greater ring IQ, and he is acquainted with Fury’s skillset from the compatriots’ time as sparring partners. Of course Fury’s game has evolved, as has Whyte’s, but their shared rounds in the ring will count for something. And when attempting to solve a puzzle as mystifying as beating Fury, ‘something’ is a start. Whyte is also a tricky fighter, his movements not easy to predict and his lead left hook – widely regarded as his best weapon – often emerging out of nowhere. Again, ask Chisora. If Fury boxes southpaw, as he did all throughout his open workout this week, he will be more susceptible to that counter punch than if he operates out of an orthodox stance. Furthermore, Whyte has a point to prove. He has waited years for this bout – for a shot at major heavyweight gold – and, according to the man himself, it cost him “a fortune in legal battles” to finally ensure his spot opposite Fury. Fury and Whyte were cordial in their first pre-fight face-off But even more dangerous than a fighter with a point to prove is a fighter free from pressure. And while it would be naive to suggest that there is no pressure on Whyte’s shoulders whatsoever, especially considering his apparent expenditure on lawyers and the incentive of a financial bonus if he wins at Wembley, the challenger has been counted out to such an extent here that he should be able to box freely. If he does so, perhaps it will be Fury who is finally counted out, in the only sense that matters in this sport. Whyte has been dismissed as having little more than a puncher’s chance against the WBC heavyweight champion. Worse boxers than Whyte have won bouts this big with that alone. The narrative that Fury will dance around, past and maybe even through Whyte is understandable. On the eve of one of the biggest fights in British heavyweight history, however, it is hard to shake the feeling that Whyte will create the kind of chaos that Wilder did against Fury. Do not be surprised if Fury is again forced to depend on his heart as much as his hands in trying to beat Whyte. If all goes to plan for the challenger, Saturday will finally be the night that Fury’s heart is not enough, and a new image crosses the aperture.

(579, '/sport/boxing/tyson-fury-dillian-whyte-weight-fight-b2041435.html', 3, 'independent', 'Fury planning on fighting Whyte at heaviest ever weight', 'Tyson Fury is planning to fight Dillian Whyte at his heaviest ever weight, and says he will enter the ring “like a man mountain” when the pair finally come face to face. In Las Vegas for his third match against Deontay Wilder last year, Fury reached a career-high weight of 19 stone, eight pounds, and defeated his opponent in one of the most sensational bouts in the history of heavyweight boxing. That put the pair’s long-running feud to bed, but a plan for Fury to face Anthony Joshua in Saudi Arabia was compromised by the latter’s defeat by Ukrainian Oleksandr Usyk in north London last autumn. That meant an automatic rematch clause was triggered and despite Fury’s team making significant financial offers to Joshua for him to step aside, he refused to do so. The WBC installed Whyte as the mandatory challenger to Fury, and after controversy over the split of the fight purse, a deal was agreed for the pair to fight at Wembley Stadium on 23 April. Now Fury says he feels he benefited from increasing his weight in recent fights and is aiming to do so again before facing Whyte, in a bout he is considered the strong favourite to win. “I’m gonna try and come in at my heaviest weight of all time,” Fury was quoted as saying by Boxing Scene. “For the biggest fight and the biggest crowd, you’re gonna see the biggest Tyson Fury. I’m gonna come in like a man mountain.” “What was my biggest weight?” Fury asked reporters. “Can anyone tell me? I think it was like 19 stone, 11 [pounds], was it? Nineteen stone, 10 [pounds]. I’m gonna come in heavier than 19 stone, 10 [pounds]. I’m gonna be the heaviest world champion ever.” The heaviest champion in boxing history is Russian Nikolai Valuev, who held the WBA title twice between 2005 and 2009 and weighed a whopping 23 stone, one pound when he defeated John Ruiz in Berlin, 17 years ago. Fury has not fought in the United Kingdom since 2018, and a crowd of up to 100,000 is expected to attend the London fight with Whyte.

(580, '/sport/boxing/tyson-fury-dillian-whyte-fight-prediction-steve-bunce-b2063140.html', 3, 'independent', 'Fury and Whyte finally fight with more than a title on the line', 'On Saturday night at Wembley Stadium, the crazy numbers in the Tyson Fury game continue with his homecoming. Fury fights his old, old friend Dillian Whyte for the WBC’s heavyweight championship of the world and the best part of about £25m. But, you probably know all that, those are the simple facts and figures. There are other numbers that make up the complicated tale behind Fury and his bandwagon of hope and inspiration. Fury has fallen headfirst from that wagon many times on the road to the Wembley ring; the road with twisted turnpikes, great pain, suffering and criticism. And a healthy dose of redemption on both sides of the ropes. His battle with good, bad and mad has been very public. There is more than just a title fight at Wembley on Saturday night. It might just be the endgame in one of boxing’s most lurid and watchable tales. Whyte is the perfect man to expose all the raw and tender sides of Fury in a fight that has taken on a life of its own. They were friends, then they stopped speaking, they were enemies and earlier this week, they embraced; their entourages were poised like two biker gangs ready to whip out the chains and instead of the expected and desired carnage, they smiled, shook hands and uttered compliments. It was not for show, it was for real, but that passivity has nothing to do with what happens at 10.10pm on Saturday night when the bell sounds. And, did I mention that 94,000 who will be there? Fury has promised to sail off in a new yacht and get fat and happy away from the ring after this fight. There are some smart boxing people who believe him; there is an argument that he is the happiest he has ever been and ready to start his life after boxing. That makes him dangerous and relaxed. The scars and years of abuse and devotion to the brutal trade have taken its toll on the big lad; the cocaine, the booze, the depression, the deaths of loved ones have hurt him. The fights have made him hard, both inside and out. He has been on his mountain top now for a long time and there might not be any more reasons for him to stay. It might just be: “Ahoy there, Captain Fury.” There were 51 months between Fury winning his world titles; the first night was as the underdog against the great Wladimir Klitschko in front of 50,000 in Düsseldorf. The second time was in Las Vegas against Deontay Wilder. In those 51 months, Fury fell out with life. He tried to die, he tried his best to annihilate his boxing history. It was utter despair and he gained about 10 stone in comfort fat. He was lost, gone from the sport. Wlad was untouchable at the time and Wilder had made 10 defences; these are facts and numbers that should never be ignored. Fury was brilliant and pure in both fights. Whyte is the fearless dance partner Fury needs for the fight he has promised; there will be no retreat from Whyte, no attempt to nick a verdict under the dark and cold north London sky. Fury will obviously move, which is his most impressive boxing asset, but he will deliver on his sacred vow to stand and fight. It is the wrong tactic against Whyte, but good heavyweight men always have great nights when they confound. Fury against Wilder II is the perfect example; Fury fought like a slugger, surrendering height, reach and sense to smash Wilder in a savage seven rounds. Nobody believed it; the following year Fury did it again. The two Wilder wins took a physical toll on Fury and perhaps that painful mileage is part of his plan to buy a yacht and sail off. Also part of the retirement plan is an inner contentment that he has nothing to prove in the ring after Saturday night, and that the waiting for Anthony Joshua is a game he no longer wants to – or needs to – play. The tiresome saga of that collapsed fight will haunt boxing long after they have gone. Whyte is here to ruin everything and he is capable of that. Fury is here to leave with that legacy enhanced and he is capable of that. They are not ordinary fighters and this is not an ordinary fight. A mobile Fury builds a lead and holds a bit; an aggressive Whyte makes Fury work at a pace and tries to push him back. They will both take risks, they have to; they promised they would and they are fighting men of their word. Fury will start very fast; Whyte will have been in the chilly ring for a good 10 minutes at that point. The minutes before they are called together by the referee will be critical; Fury grows big and manic in those final seconds and Whyte must not shrink. In Las Vegas, in 2020, Wilder was beaten before the bell sounded. I saw him vanish in front of me, the latest magic trick in the city of mirages. And then they will fight. Fury will find a way. I would be amazed if it is easy. I would not be shocked if there is controversy. Please, sit back and enjoy two British heavyweights making history on a night in London. Watch Fury vs Whyte.

Some 3.76 million people in the UK are estimated to have tested positive for Covid-19 over the most recent seven day period covered by the data, a decrease from the previous week’s figure of 4.41 million. In the week ending 16 April, one in 17 people were likely to test positive for the virus in England. This is a decrease from the previous week’s data, which showed one in 14 had the disease. Northern Ireland saw the biggest decrease, with one in 30 people suspected to have the virus, compared to one in 19 in last week’s dataset. In Wales, one in 15 people were thought to be carrying the virus, down from one in 13. In Scotland, the estimated number of infected people dropped from one in 17 people to one in 19 people. Meanwhile, the number of people infected with the Omicron variant has fallen in England to just under 60 in every 1,000 people. In Scotland, it is just over 50 per 1,000 people. The number of people infected with the Omicron variant has also fallen Professor James Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute, and professor of structural biology at the University of Oxford, said: “Where Scotland has gone, England will likely follow. Prevalence peaked around the middle of March at around 84 people in every thousand. Prevalence has fallen in every region and in all age groups. “All things being equal a fall in prevalence should feed through to reduced pressure in hospitals which are clearly under extreme stress. This will lead to a fall in deaths, which have continued to rob families of their loved ones.” Hospital admissions decreased in the week ending 17 April, to 16.17 per 100,000 people. This is down from 19.94 per 100,000 people the previous week. Hospital admissions decreased for those over the age of five, but increased for those aged zero to four. The largest decrease was those aged 85 and above. However, hospital admission rates still remain the highest for this group. The lowest rates of hospitalisation were those aged five to 14.

(597, '/news/health/nottingham-maternity-scandal-baby-deaths-b2063523.html', 8, 'independent', 'NHS orders new chair for maternity scandal review', 'The NHS has ordered a new chair for the Nottingham maternity scandal review which is looking into hundreds of cases of alleged poor care.  In a letter published late on Friday the NHS said there needed to be “urgent” changes to the way the review was being carried out and this included appointing a former NHS trust chair Julie Dent to lead the review.  More than 100 bereaved families wrote to the health secretary Sajid Javid on 7 April calling for the review, to be overhauled and the chair Cathy Purt, to be replaced by Donna Ockenden who chaired the Shrewsbury maternity scandal inquiry.  The Nottingham review, dubbed an “independent thematic review”, was launched in July 2021 and is being led by local NHS commissioners and NHS England.  It was announced after The Independent and Channel 4 revealed millions had been paid out by the trust over 30 baby deaths and 46 incidents of babies left permanently brain damaged by Nottingham University Hospitals Foundation Trust. Families said to the health secretary in a letter on 7 April they had no confidence in the thematic review and called for an independent review to replace it.  The families said they were concerned enough had been done to promote the review or reach out to other families. In April the number of people that had come forward to reviewers jumped from 87 to 461.  They also raised “significant concern” over the independence of thematic review as it had been commissioned by former employees of the trust.  In response to a letter from the families, Ms Ockenden said she would be happy to lead the review subject to being asked. It is not clear whether the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) had contacted Ms Ockenden. On Thursday families speaking with The Independent said they had not received any communication from the Department of Health and Social Care or NHS England since the letter was sent on 7 April. Sir David Sloman, the NHS chief operating officer, said in his letter on Friday: “Following discussions at both a regional and national level, it is clear that urgent changes to how the review is being delivered need to be made. A new chair needs to lead this review with sufficient senior experience to address the concerns and challenges faced at Nottingham University Hospitals, to speed up the process and to deliver a review that can bring about real change for women and babies in Nottingham. “It has therefore been agreed that the review will now have enhanced national oversight by NHS England and NHS Improvement and I am pleased to announce that Julie Dent CBE has agreed to take on the role of chair for this review and she will begin this work with immediate effect.” The letter said the new chair Ms Dent would lead the current review team and consider what changes needed to be made to the terms of reference and methodology. Mr Javid said: “I take patient safety concerns extremely seriously - no mother or baby should ever receive unsafe maternity care. “Like with the Ockenden review, we are acting swiftly to urgently bring about real change through the Nottingham University Hospitals Maternity Review so that no families have to go through the same pain in future. “I am confident the appointment of Julie Dent – with her extensive leadership and health sector experience – will deliver an independent review that addresses these tragic failures.”  Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(598, '/news/health/patient-neglect-private-hospital-b2062698.html', 8, 'independent', 'Priory hospital failings contributed to death of man killed by train', 'The NHS should stop sending patients to Priory-run mental health hospitals after a patient who fled a facility died when he was hit by a train, the victim’s father has said. Matthew Caseby, 23, died from head injuries in September 2020 after he escaped over a fence from the Priory Hospital Woodbourne in Birmingham and was later struck by a train. Following a two-week inquest, jurors ruled on Thursday that a series of failings by the hospital led to him leaving the unit unattended, which contributed to his death.  His father, Richard Caseby, has called for NHS England to review its policy of sending patients to private units such as the Priory Group. The organisation is one of the largest providers of mental health inpatient services in the UK with hundreds of millions spent on sending NHS patients to its hospitals each year.  According to analysis by the charity Inquest, there have been at least 21 patient deaths at Priory Group facilities - a figure previously criticised by coroners. Following the inquest into Mr Caseby’s death, senior coroner for Birmingham and Solihull, Louise Hunt, will issue a prevention of future deaths report to the Priory Group and to the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Sajid Javid. The report will say there should be national guidelines on security in acute mental health units, particularly in relation to the height of fences.  Mr Caseby suffered a mental health crisis on 3 September 2020 and was detained by Thames Valley police in Oxford. Two days later he was sent 80 miles away to the Priory Hospital in Birmingham. The inquest found that prior to him leaving the hospital, he was left unattended in a courtyard by staff, a move deemed “inappropriate and unsafe”.  Staff had raised concerns he might climb the fence and leave the hospital, however there was no evidence those concerns were followed up or recorded.  Upon being admitted to the hospital, he was assessed as being at low risk of suicide and self harm, but later in the day it was noted he was at risk of fleeing.  The inquest heard the hospital’s recording processes were inadequate, resulting in a lack of communication by staff caring for Mr Caseby. There was no policy in place for the level of observations needed within the hospital’s courtyard, which made it “unsuitable for patients”. The inquest also highlighted that despite staff having concerns over the height of the fence, they were not raised officially. That was despite senior managers being aware of incidents occurring before Mr Caseby’s death.  Speaking after the inquest concluded, Richard Caseby said: “Matthew was a beautiful, gentle and intelligent young man whose ambition was to help everyone live a better life through exercise. He was loved by his family and he had so much promise. “In a litany of failings, the Woodbourne Priory failed to assess Matthew’s risk of absconsion when it should have been high. It also wrongly assessed him as a low suicide risk even though he was diagnosed as psychotic and had been originally detained for his own safety because he had been running on train lines. “The hospital was aware of previous escapes over the same low fence and yet had done nothing to improve security.”  He added that the NHS trust that sent his son to the Priory Hospital, Birmingham Women’s and Children’s Foundation Trust, had failed to conduct any assurance visits over the two years before his death.  “The trust should have had far better oversight in respect of patients’ safety. The inquest heard expert evidence that the trust had also failed to take all reasonable measures to prevent harm to Matthew. To prevent such tragedies ever happening again, NHS England should review its national policy of outsourcing mental health beds to a supplier like the Priory, which consistently fails to keep patients safe,” he said.  Deborah Coles, director of the charity Inquest, said: “Inquest is deeply concerned by the number of deaths occurring at Priory-run mental health units nationally. Issues raised at this inquest around risk assessment, observations, and addressing known dangers are occurring time and time again. Yet no action is taken.”  A Priory Group spokesman said: “We would like to say how deeply sorry we are to Matthew’s family, and we apologise unreservedly for the shortcomings in care identified during both the investigation process and the inquest.  “We accept that the care provided at Woodbourne in this instance fell below the high standard patients and their families rightly expect from us, and we fully recognise that improvements are needed to the service. “We have already implemented changes in relation to policies, procedures and the hospital environment, but we will now carefully study the coroner’s findings.” An NHS spokesperson said: “Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the family and friends of Matthew Caseby.” It added the NHS expected all services to provide safe and high-quality care and it continues to work with the Care Quality Commission to monitor this.

Carolyn Harris, who chairs the parliamentary group which specialises in menopause, told The Independent she is “very angry” about the dearth of HRT - a treatment which alleviates menopausal symptoms - as she blamed the government for the problem. The majority of the 3.4 million women between 50 and 64 in the UK will be experiencing symptoms of the menopause – with these ranging from heart palpitations to hot flushes, vaginal pain and changes in mood. Since 2019, the UK has been hit with a nationwide HRT shortage as a consequence of manufacturing and supply issues. Ms Harris said the shortage is leaving menopausal women “exhausted, frustrated, confused and frightened” - arguing the problem is caused by the government failing to predict and respond to the surge in demand for HRT triggered by greater awareness of the menopause. The politician added: “It is scary. Women who can’t get HRT will be making really bad decisions because of brain fog. They will be giving up work, and there will be relationships ending, and women even contemplating suicide.  “They don’t understand what is going on in their body and can’t get the medication to stop it from happening.”  Ms Harris, the Labour MP for Swansea East, noted all these issues also apply to women who are unable to afford HRT as she accused the government of not sticking to their promise to make HRT prescriptions free in England. HRT is currently free in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The politician explained she negotiated with the government in October last year that she would pull her landmark menopause rights bill calling for free HRT on the agreement ministers would reduce the costs to one annual fee. “They said that would happen soon this year but it has not started and it is not going to happen until April 2023,” Ms Harris added. She said the surge in women requesting HRT prescriptions was triggered by the swelling menopause rights campaign as she explained growing awareness has made women “confident enough” to go back to their GP to tell them they want to come off antidepressants and be prescribed HRT instead. Ms Harris added: “I am very angry about the HRT shortage and frustrated for the women who can’t get HRT. It is cruel. The government could do something by making sure the alternative products sitting in manufacturers are made available. “It is bad planning by the suppliers and bad planning by the government. The government are responsible for working with health boards to find out what the demand is for prescriptions.” Menopause campaigners have previously warned of the link between suicide and the menopause.  Diane Danzebrink, who runs the Menopause Support network, which works with 10,000 women, previously told The Independent: “The shortage places some women at risk of becoming potentially suicidal.  “The biggest risk of suicide for women is between the ages of 50 and 54. The average age of menopause is 51. That is not a coincidence. My menopause made me suicidal – I got very close to putting my car in front of a lorry.” Ms Harris’ scathing comments come after Caroline Nokes, an ex-cabinet minister, said women are struggling to “sleep and work competently” as a result of the HRT shortage.  Ms Nokes, a Conservative MP, said: “Pharmacies in Romsey and Southampton North have completely run out, which leaves women of a certain age - and before my honourable friend from North Dorset makes a comment … yes, I declare an interest - without access to the oestrogen gel, which enables us to sleep and to work competently. While Mark Spencer, the Commons leader, responded: “I can say the Department of Health and Social Care is aware of the supply issues that are affecting a limited number of HRT products. However, most HRT products, including alternatives to those experiencing supply issues, are available. “The government is working closely with suppliers and stakeholders to resolve these issues as quickly as possible, and to ensure the NHS is informed on a regular basis.” The last five years have seen the number of HRT prescriptions in England double. Ministers pledged to substantially reduce the price of HRT prescriptions last October. Dr Edward Morris, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists’ president, told The Independent: “We understand that the shortages of some types of HRT can be distressing for women.  “We strongly encourage women who have been affected by these shortages to speak to a healthcare professional, as many alternatives are available. They will also be able to advise other treatment options if an exact match is not possible. “The British Menopause Society website provides regular updates on the availability of HRT, and advice on alternative HRT preparations that are available for products in short supply.” It comes after The Independent reported nine in 10 women going through menopause experience mental health issues, with many suffering “crippling” anxiety and depression.

(600, '/news/health/faint-line-mean-lateral-flow-test-b2060606.html', 8, 'independent', 'What does a faint line mean on a lateral flow test? ', 'The UK has experienced another rise in Covid-19 infections in recent weeks, the latest surge driven by a sub-lineage of the Omicron variant known as BA.2. However, the uptick now appears to be subsiding, with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) recording 281,269 positive tests within seven days on 11 April, as well as 1,613 deaths and 16,438 people admitted to hospital. The sub-lineage is currently estimated to account for approximately 93.7 per cent of cases in England, with the highest prevalence in the South East (96.4 per cent) of the country and the lowest in the East Midlands (91.1 per cent), according to the UKHSA. Boris Johnson’s government ended all social restrictions in England on 24 February and followed that by scrapping the provision of free lateral flow tests (LFTs) on 1 April as part of its pivot towards a “Living with Covid” strategy, assuming the worst of the pandemic to be over. But the latest wave of cases has already created renewed demand for LFTs in pharmacies, which reported a 400 per cent increase in sales in the final week of last month. Still the most straightforward means of determining whether or not you have contracted Covid from home, LFTs typically retail for £2.50 each or £12 for a pack of five and use a test strip that changes colour to indicate whether the saliva sample you provide contains traces of the coronavirus. Once you have squeezed droplets from your sample onto the plastic reader, a single hard line will appear next to the letter C (for “control”) at the testing window to confirm that the test has worked successfully. A second red line will duly appear next to the letter T (for “test”) if the virus is present in your sample, although this line can sometimes appear very faint. According to the government’s guidance, the reason for this is that LFTs can be less sensitive when a person has lower levels of the virus in their system, although the appearance of any line at all means that your test is positive, that you have contracted Covid and that you should consider yourself infectious. “Even faint lines indicate the test is positive,” the official advice states, adding: “Result lines may appear smudged or faint, but they are still valid results and must be reported.” However, no test is 100 per cent accurate all the time and it is possible for the LFTs to return a false positive, typically if the sample you provide has inadvertently been contaminated or if you wait beyond the 15-30 minute recommended in the instruction ket to determine your result. If you do test positive for Covid, you are no longer legally required to self-isolate, although the NHS does recommend working from home where possible to avoid passing on the disease to colleagues, friends and family, particularly as others may be more vulnerable than you. Prior to the scrapping of social restrictions, the public were advised to leave isolation after five days if they tested negative on two consecutive days or after 10 days of quarantine if they continued to test positive. This article was amended on 22 April 2022 to remove a reference to litmus paper. While the test cartridge contains a strip that changes colour to indicate a positive test, it does not use litmus paper.

(601, '/news/health/covid-london-hiv-portugal-lisbon-b2063239.html', 8, 'independent', 'Longest known Covid infection lasted 505 days, study finds', 'A Covid-19 patient tested positive for 505 days before their death, making it the longest known coronavirus infection, UK researchers have said. The previous longest known infection is thought to have lasted 335 days. Most people who contract the virus are able to clear the infection naturally, but the patient in question had a severely weakened immune system and multiple comorbidities – other conditions. They first started showing symptoms and tested positive in early 2020, and tested positive many times until dying in 2021. The researchers, who studied the virus from nine Covid patients in London, also provide evidence that new Covid variants may arise in immunocompromised individuals. Presenting their details at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases (ECCMID) in Lisbon, Portugal, they describe details of one of the first occult Covid infections – cases where the patient was thought to have cleared the virus with a negative test but is subsequently found to have had an ongoing infection. The team, from King’s College London and Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, were interested in how the virus changes over time in immunocompromised individuals. This provides evidence that mutations found in variants of concern do arise in immunocompromised patients and so supports the idea that new variants of the viruses may develop in immunocompromised individuals First author Dr Luke Blagdon Snell, of Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, said: “New variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, have emerged throughout the pandemic. “Some of these variants transmit more easily between people, cause more severe disease, or make the vaccines less effective. “One theory is that these viral variants evolve in individuals whose immune systems are weakened from illness or medical treatments like chemotherapy, who can have persistent infection with SARS-CoV-2. “We wanted to investigate which mutations arise, and if variants evolve, in these people with persistent infection.” Nine immunocompromised patients who tested positive for the virus for at least eight weeks were included in the study. Infections lasted for 73 days, on average, but two patients had persistent infections for more than a year. The patients, who were studied between March 2020 and December 2021, had weakened immune systems due to organ transplantation, HIV, cancer, or medical therapies for other illnesses. Analysis showed that five of the nine patients developed at least one mutation seen in variants of concern. Some of the people developed multiple mutations associated with variants of concern, such as Alpha, Delta and Omicron. The researchers found that the virus from one patient contained 10 mutations that would arise separately in variants of concern, such as Alpha, Gamma and Omicron. Dr Snell and colleagues said: “This provides evidence that mutations found in variants of concern do arise in immunocompromised patients and so supports the idea that new variants of the viruses may develop in immunocompromised individuals. “It is important to note, however, that none of the individuals in our work developed new variants that became widespread variants of concern. “Additionally, whilst this work shows variants could arise in immunocompromised individuals, whether the previous variants of concern like Alpha, Delta and Omicron arose in this manner remains unknown.” Five of the nine patients survived, and one still has an infection. At their last follow-up in early 2022, that patient had been infected for 412 days. The person has been treated with monoclonal antibodies, but if they still test positive at their next appointment, researchers suggest they will likely pass the longest known infection of 505 days as described in the new study.

The patient had a severely weakened immune system, researchers said, adding that their study proved the need for continued precautions to protect vulnerable people, especially as many countries — including the UK itself — ease Covid restrictions. Dr Luke Blagdon Snell, an infectious disease expert at the Guy’s & St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, said that at 505 days, this “certainly seems to be the longest reported infection”, though it cannot be stated for certain because not all cases are reported or tested consistently as in this case.  Before this, researchers had believed that the longest-lasting Covid infection was for 335 days. Dr Snell’s team conducted the study on nine patients who tested positive for Covid for at least eight weeks. Five of those patients survived, but the person who had Covid for 505 days has died. All patients involved in the study had weakened immune systems due to a host of reasons, including organ transplants, HIV, cancer or treatment from other illnesses. Repeated tests conducted on the nine patients showed that their infections continued for an average of 73 days. Two patients had Covid for more than a year. Through repeated testing, researchers analysed the genetic code of the virus to determine whether it was the same strain or not and to see if patients got Covid more than once. Researchers said the genetic sequencing showed that the virus changed over time and mutated. Dr Snell added that the mutations were similar to those that later showed up in widespread variants. “This provides evidence that mutations found in variants of concern do arise in immunocompromised patients and so supports the idea that new variants of the viruses may develop in immunocompromised individuals,” Dr Snell said in a press release. “It is important to note, however, that none of the individuals in our work developed new variants that became widespread variants of concern. “Additionally, whilst this work shows variants could arise in immunocompromised individuals, whether the previous variants of concern like Alpha, Delta and Omicron arose in this manner remains unknown.” Scientists said that the research shows the need for continued precautions as countries lift Covid norms. “Masking in crowds is a considerate thing to do and a way we can protect others,” said Dr Wesley Long, a pathologist at Houston Methodist in Texas, who was not part of the research.

All we know about new Covid variant ', 'A new sub-variant of Omicron has been found in UK as the country battles a renewed surge of the coronavirus. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that 4.9 million people in the UK were infected with Covid-19 as of last weekend - a record high during the pandemic. The surge is cases is thought to be down to people mixing more freely since Covid restrictions were dropped and the Omicron BA.2 sub-variant. But now a further mutation has been detected that could be more transmissible, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned. XE combines genetic characteristic of the Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants, in what is known as a “recombinant”.  In a report released last week the WHO said the XE recombinant was first detected in the UK on 19 January and said early tests showed it could be more transmissible. The report said: “Early-day estimates indicate a community growth rate advantage of 10 per cent as compared to BA.2, however this finding requires further confirmation.  “XE belongs to the Omicron variant until significant differences in transmission and disease characteristics, including severity, may be reported.” The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said on Monday that the most recent data showed XE had a growth rate 9.8 per cent above BA.2. However it cautioned that “as this estimate has not remained consistent as new data have been added, it cannot yet be interpreted as an estimate of growth advantage for the recombinant.” “Numbers were too small for the XE recombinant to be analysed by region,” the UKHSA said. In a report released last week the WHO said the XE recombinant was first detected in the UK on January 19 The UKHSA has said that as of 22 March, 637 cases of XE had been detected in England. This is only a small fraction of cases, with the latest data from the ONS, showing that a record 4.9 million currently have coronavirus.  The variant has also been detected in Thailand.  As the sub variant is new, the situation may change but currently it is not thought that XE comes with new symptoms.  The most reported symptoms of the original strain of Omicron are much like a cold, especially in people who’ve been vaccinated.  This would include running noses, sneezing and sore throats, as opposed to the original strain of the virus which generally led to fever, coughs and a loss of taste or smell.  However, the official NHS list of general Covid symptoms was expanded on Monday to include nine new signs of illness. According to nhs.uk the signs of Covid-19 that people should also look out for include: shortness of breath, feeling tired or exhausted, an aching body, a headache, a sore throat, a blocked or runny nose, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, feeling sick or being sick.

Inspectors said they were also concerned about numerous ligature points at the Schoen Clinic York, and patients were not always treated with compassion or respect. They were among a string of failings highlighted by the Care Quality Commission, which has placed the hospital into special measures and rated it inadequate. Some patients reported that staff made insensitive comments to them, which hampered their recovery, the watchdog said, following an inspection in January. And they did not always receive the emotional support they needed, telling inspectors they did not feel clinic managers listened to them. But staff themselves reported feeling unable to raise concerns without fear of bullying and harassment from managers, amid signs of a “closed culture” at the hospital, the commission says. The hospital, which is run by Newbridge Care Systems, says issues initially found were quickly addressed with corrective action taken within four weeks - work that was not reflected in the final report. The CQC report also said: ·         The clinic did not always have enough nursing and support staff to keep people safe, and risks were not assessed, managed or mitigated properly ·         Emergency equipment was not checked regularly ·         The staff alarm system needed reviewing, which meant an emergency response could be delayed ·         Food offered did not meet the complex needs of patients ·         Incidents and safeguarding issues were not always reported appropriately Brian Cranna, the CQC’s head of hospital inspection, said: “The standards of care we found were putting patients at risk, so we have taken urgent enforcement action, which means the service must improve if it’s to retain its registration. “We found people didn’t always receive the levels of care they have a right to expect and weren’t always treated with compassion and respect. “Individual dietary needs weren’t always considered, and people weren’t involved in the planning of their care and treatment. “Evidence of a closed culture, where people aren’t listened to, and issues aren’t escalated appropriately, was particularly concerning. “An environment where people feel unable to speak up or where incidents aren’t recorded is completely unacceptable.” The report said that to the clinic’s credit, ward areas were clean and well maintained and there was enough medical cover, including a doctor available in an emergency. The Schoen Clinic Group said it was disappointed by the rating being downgraded, and that it had worked with the CQC to take all steps required for improvement. It said NHS England who had been supportive of its actions and was “assured that our York facility is a safe and caring environment for their patients”. “The Schoen Clinic Group have invested significantly into this service including a facility upgrade, new systems and safety procedures, and we remain proud of our record of no serious clinical incidents,” it added. “The issues initially raised in the report were quickly addressed with corrective action taken within four weeks, and whilst we are disappointed that this work hasn’t been reflected in the final report, we welcome the CQC to return to Schoen Clinic York at any time to allow us to demonstrate our commitment to delivering the highest possible standards of quality patient care.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

Researchers say that for the first time it is possible to detect patterns – called mutational signatures – in the DNA of cancers. These provide clues including about whether a patient has had past exposure to environmental causes of cancer such as smoking or UV light, for example. This is important as these signatures allow doctors to look at each patient’s tumour and match it to specific treatments and medications. The reason it is important to identify mutational signatures is because they are like fingerprints at a crime scene - they help to pinpoint cancer culprits However, these patterns can only be detected through the analysis of the vast amounts of data unearthed by whole genome sequencing – identifying the genetic make-up of a cell. Principal author Serena Nik-Zainal is a professor of genomic medicine and bioinformatics at the University of Cambridge and an honorary consultant in clinical genetics at Cambridge University Hospitals. She said: “It’s like looking at a very busy beach with thousands of footprints in the sand. “To the untrained eye, the footprints appear to be random and meaningless. “But if you are able to study them closely, you can learn a lot about what’s been going on, distinguish between animal and human prints, whether it’s an adult or child, what direction they’re travelling in, etc. “It’s the same thing with the mutational signatures. “The use of whole genome sequencing can identify which ‘footprints’ are relevant/important and reveal what’s happened through the development of the cancer.” Researchers analysed the complete genetic make-up or whole genome sequences (WGS) of more than 12,000 NHS cancer patients. With thousands of mutations per cancer, we have unprecedented power to look for commonalities and differences across NHS patients They were able to spot 58 new mutational signatures, suggesting that there are additional causes of cancer that are not yet fully understood. Prof Nik-Zainal said: “The reason it is important to identify mutational signatures is because they are like fingerprints at a crime scene – they help to pinpoint cancer culprits. “Some mutational signatures have clinical or treatment implications – they can highlight abnormalities that may be targeted with specific drugs or may indicate a potential ‘Achilles heel’ in individual cancers.” Dr Andrea Degasperi, research associate at the University of Cambridge and first author, said: “Whole genome sequencing gives us a total picture of all the mutations that have contributed to each person’s cancer. “With thousands of mutations per cancer, we have unprecedented power to look for commonalities and differences across NHS patients, and in doing so we uncovered 58 new mutational signatures and broadened our knowledge of cancer.” The findings are now being incorporated into the NHS as researchers and clinicians now have the use of a digital tool called FitMS that will help them identify the mutational signature and potentially inform cancer management more effectively. This research was supported by Cancer Research UK and published in the journal Science. This study shows how powerful whole genome sequencing tests can be in giving clues into how the cancer may have developed, how it will behave and what treatment options would work best The genomic data was provided by the 100,000 Genomes Project, an England-wide clinical research programme to sequence 100,000 whole genomes from around 85,000 patients affected by rare disease or cancer. Michelle Mitchell, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said: “This study shows how powerful whole genome sequencing tests can be in giving clues into how the cancer may have developed, how it will behave and what treatment options would work best.” Professor Matt Brown, chief scientific officer of Genomics England, said: “Mutational signatures are an example of using the full potential of WGS. “We hope to use the mutational clues seen in this study and apply them back into our patient population, with the ultimate aim of improving diagnosis and management of cancer patients.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(607, '/news/health/covid-woman-test-positive-twice-b2062261.html', 8, 'independent', 'Woman infected with two Covid variants within record 20 days', 'A health worker in Spain caught Covid twice in 20 days in what is the shortest-known gap between infections, Spanish researchers have said.  The 31-year-old woman was infected with two different variants, Delta in late December and Omicron in January.  The healthworker did not develop any symptoms after her first positive PCR test in December.  However, within a few weeks she developed a cough and fever and took another test, which again showed positive.  Analyses on the tests showed that the patient had been infected with two different variants of the virus.  The 31-year-old woman was infected with two different variants In a presentation at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, study author Dr Gemma Recio said the case highlighted that Omicron can “evade the previous immunity acquired either from a natural infection with other variants or from vaccines”.  Dr Recio, from the Institut Catala de Salut, Tarragona in Spain, said: “In other words, people who have had Covid-19 cannot assume they are protected against reinfection, even if they have been fully vaccinated. “Nevertheless, both previous infection with other variants and vaccination do seem to partially protect against severe disease and hospitalisation in those with Omicron.” The study’s author also said that it was important to monitor reinfections of people who were fully vaccinated. In the UK, reinfections require 90 days between positive tests.  Health officials say that nearly 900,000 people have potentially been infected twice with Covid up to the start of April. However, it is hard to give a precise number because not all positive tests go through the whole genome sequencing needed to check if infections are from different strains.  According to UK government data, in the week leading up to April 20, 174,982 people had a confirmed positive test result. This is a decrease of 31 per cent compared to the previous seven days.  However, these results do reflect how many people have the virus without knowing as free lateral flow tests were scrapped earlier this month as part of the government’s Living with Covid plan. Covid reinfections shot up in December 2021 after the much more infectious Omicron variant emerged. March saw another increase of infections when a slightly different version of Omicron, called BA.2, appeared.

Everything you need to know', 'The Omicron variant of Covid-19 spread rapidly across the UK in December and January before the infection rate gradually fell away, emboldening Boris Johnson to drop the “Plan B” restrictions brought in to stop the spread before Christmas. Speaking in the House of Commons in February, the prime minister said that guidance on mask-wearing in public places and presenting Covid passes to enter crowded venues would be scrapped as the New Year spike in infections waned without having resulted in the mass hospitalisations experts had feared. Work from home guidance was also lifted, with people no longer encouraged to work remotely as had been the official guidance since 8 December 2021, as was the requirement to self-isolate, which was dropped a month ahead of schedule as the government sought to pivot to a “Living with Covid” strategy. Nevertheless, as the recent surge in infections from the BA.2 Omicron sub-lineage reminded us, the pandemic is far from over and the variant remains a threat, so members of the public are still being urged to get their third (or fourth) vaccine jab to boost immunity as soon as they can. NHS rules on boosters were relaxed in December so that all over-18s were offered a third jab, a decision supported by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which also recommended cutting the period between second and third jabs from six months to three in a bid to beat the variant. You can currently get a booster if you are over 18 – or over 16 with a health condition – and it has been at least three months (91 days) since you received your second dose of one of the approved Covid vaccines. If you are eligible for a vaccine booster jab, you no longer have to wait for the NHS to contact you to make an appointment online. If you are struggling to secure a booking due to high demand, you can also visit any walk-in vaccination centre to get your jab, with people being advised to use the NHS online walk-in finder to locate their nearest centre. If you have had a positive Covid test, you are advised to wait four weeks (28 days) before booking your booster, starting from the date you had the test. “NHS staff are making it as easy as possible for people to get their top-up vaccination,” said Dr Nikki Kanani, deputy lead for the NHS Covid-19 vaccination programme. “People can now go online, find their nearest site and go and get their booster without delay. The booster is not just nice to have, it is really important protection. So if you are eligible, please do check the site finder and go get your jab.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

Speaking in the House of Commons in January, the prime minister said that working from home orders, guidance on mask-wearing in public places and presenting NHS Covid passes to enter crowded venues were all being scrapped as the New Year rise in infections waned without resulting in the wave of mass hospitalisations feared by experts. “Venues and events will no longer be required by law to use the NHS Covid Pass,” the Department of Health elaborated on the latter point on the government’s website. “The NHS Covid Pass can still be used on a voluntary basis as was previously the case in Plan A.” The pass had been unpopular with many of Mr Johnson’s fellow Conservatives since its introduction, some of whom considered it an infringement of civil liberties, a stance Tory MP Marcus Fysh took to extreme lengths when he compared their implementation to Nazi Germany. A significant backbench rebellion occurred on Tuesday 14 December when MPs voted to approve the Plan B restrictions in the House of Commons, the revolt also in part a protest against the PM’s increasingly frazzled and scandal-ridden leadership. The Liberal Democrats likewise raised objections to the passes, accusing the government earlier in 2021 of introducing ID cards “by stealth” when the NHS app was updated and has since labelled them “illiberal and destructive”, warning that they “represent a massive change in the relationship between everyday people and their government”. However, given that Sir Keir Starmer’s opposition Labour Party was always going to support the government’s position, believing it to be in the national interest, the mutiny failed to prevent their adoption. To access your digital NHS Covid Pass, you need to have the free NHS app downloaded to your smartphone – and to be registered with a GP in England to be able to access it. By simply signing into the app, you will be able to show proof of your Covid-19 vaccination or negative test status upon request, the information presented along with a QR code for scanning. The code proving your vaccination is valid for 30 days from the moment you access it or download it as a PDF, after which you will need to refresh to obtain a new version. A Covid Pass secured via a negative test result will meanwhile only last for 48 hours before a new version is needed (obtained via the same simple means). If you are unable to use the app for any reason, you can also view your vaccination status on the NHS website or print a paper version at home before heading to your destination. Those unable to access online services can also call 119 to request a letter to serve as evidence of their vaccination status instead. Those unable to get vaccinated or tested for medical reasons can apply to the NHS for an exemption to stand in its place. You can find more information on the government’s website.

(610, '/news/science/coronavirus-infection-recovery-long-covid-b2062154.html', 8, 'independent', 'Nearly half of those recovering from Covid may experience ‘long Covid’', 'An analysis of data from 50 studies looking at 1.6 million people suggests that as much as 43 per cent of those infected with the coronavirus experienced post-Covid conditions, pointing to the need for better diagnosis and care for “long Covid” patients. Post-Covid conditions are clinically defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as mid- and long-term symptoms – also known as long Covid – occurring in individuals after infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The research, published this week in the Journal of Infectious Disease, assessed 23 symptoms reported across 36 of the studies and found that shortness of breath, sleep problems, and joint pain was widely reported by those who had recovered from the novel coronavirus infection. Scientists analysed the prevalence of this condition globally and regionally, estimating the proportion of individuals facing long Covid in Asia, Europe and North America. They found that the global prevalence for post-Covid conditions at 30, 60, 90 and 120 days after infection was about 37, 25, 32, and 49 per cent respectively. Researchers say fatigue (23 per cent) and memory problems (14 per cent) were the most common symptoms of individuals experiencing post-Covid conditions. “I was really surprised to see the results of this meta-analysis, and in particular that fatigue and memory problems were the two most commonly reported post-Covid conditions,” study co-author Bhramar Mukherjee from the University of Michigan School of Public Health said. While about 34 per cent of non-hospitalised coronavirus patients report lingering post-Covid symptoms, scientists say this rate jumps to over 50 per cent for hospitalised Covid patients. Asia has the highest post-Covid condition prevalence at 51 per cent, according to the study. This was followed by Europe at 44 per cent, and North America at 31 per cent. The study highlights the changing landscape of Covid-19 due to new variants that may have implications for the prevalence of long Covid and symptom burden in the future. It also points out the variation across the world in long Covid diagnosis which makes it challenging to synthesise studies. “Long Covid is quite common overall and across geographic regions, sex and acute COVID-19 severity. Knowing this, providers should take proactive approaches such that their patients are well-supported when experiencing long-term health effects of Covid-19,” scientists wrote in the study. Citing the limitations of the analysis, researchers said they only considered studies written in English, which may have excluded those written in other languages. Scientists also noted that a bias in testing for Covid-19 across the world, especially in the early stages of the pandemic, may have affected the characteristics of the positive cohort included in the meta-analysis. “Future research needs to further explore risk factors and 2 duration, as these are generally critical components in screening patients for increased risk of 3 developing post Covid-19 condition, and in devising an appropriate treatment protocol,” they added.

(611, '/news/health/omicron-symptoms-vaccinated-covid-incubation-period-b2062203.html', 8, 'independent', 'Omicron symptoms affecting vaccinated — and two signs you may have it', 'China has put nearly 30 million people under strict lockdown measures as the country recorded a steep rise in new coronavirus infections, which have hit a two-year high. The country has taken some of the most drastic measures since the start of the pandemic, even though its caseload is low compared with other major countries because it has tethered itself tightly to a “zero-Covid” strategy. The latest increase is due to Omicron, reported to be the dominant variant. First detected in Southern Africa and Hong Kong in November 2021, Omicron was soon confirmed as the dominant variant in the UK in December.  Here, we take a look at some of the most common symptoms with the new variant for the fully vaccinated, and two early warning signs you might have it.  Most common symptoms for the fully vaccinated Researchers in Norway conducted a study interviewing 111 out of 117 guests from a party on 26 November 2021 where there was an Omicron outbreak. Of the group interviewed, 66 had definitive cases of Covid-19 and 15 had possible cases of the virus.  Of the 111 participants, 89 per cent had received two doses of an mRNA vaccine and none had received a booster shot.  According to the findings published in infectious disease and epidemiology journal, Eurosurveillance, there were eight key symptoms experienced by the group of fully vaccinated partygoers.  (Danny Lawson/PA) These were cough, runny nose, fatigue, sore throat, headache, muscle pain, fever and sneezing. The study found that cough, runny nose and fatigue were among the most common symptoms in the vaccinated individuals while sneezing and fever were least common.  Public health experts also add nausea to this list of symptoms in vaccinated people who have contracted the Omicron variant.  Although the vaccine protects against the more serious risks of the virus, it is still possible to contract Covid even if you have both jabs and a booster shot.  The mild nature of the symptoms makes it hard for people to distinguish the virus from a common cold.  But, according to Professor Tim Spector, behind the ZOE Symptom Study App, around 50 per cent of “‘new colds’ currently are, in fact, Covid”.  Two early warning signs you may have Omicron Experts also suggest there are two distinct symptoms that could be a sign a positive test is around the corner: fatigue and dizziness/ fainting.  More than simply feeling tired, fatigue can translate to bodily pain by causing sore or weak muscles, headaches, and even blurry vision and loss of appetite. Dr Angelique Coetzee, a private practitioner and chair of the South African Medical Association, told Good Morning Britain that fatigue was one of the main symptoms of Omicron when the variant broke out in South Africa. In fact, 40 per cent of women reported they struggled with fatigue due to Covid compared to one-third of men, according to a poll by Web MD that asked users how often they had fatigue from 23 December to 4 January.  Dizziness/ fainting is the second sign that you may have Omicron. A new report from Germany has suggested that there is a link between fainting spells and Omicron after doctors in Berlin found that Covid was triggering recurrent fainting spells for a 35-year-old patient admitted to hospital.  German newspaper Ärztezeitung said that the doctors could see a “clear connection” between the infection and the fainting spells.

The 31-year-old woman from Spain became infected with the Delta variant followed by the Omicron variant of the virus in under three weeks. Researchers said the case shows that even vaccinated people who have had Covid-19 “cannot assume they are protected against reinfection”. The woman, who has been kept anonymous, became infected in December 2021, 12 days after she received her Covid booster vaccine. People who have had Covid-19 cannot assume they are protected against reinfection, even if they have been fully vaccinated The first positive result was picked up through routine healthcare testing. She had no symptoms and went into isolation for 10 days. But just days after returning to work in January she began to show symptoms of Covid-19 – a cough and fever as well as feeling generally unwell – and took a test which yielded a positive result. Lab tests showed that she was initially infected by the Delta variant of the virus which causes Covid-19, and then by the Omicron variant. Her case, which is being presented to the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases in Portugal, is believed to be the shortest known gap between infections. Dr Gemma Recio, of the Institut Catala de la Salut in Spain, one of the study’s authors, said: “This case highlights the potential of the Omicron variant to evade the previous immunity acquired either from a natural infection with other variants or from vaccines. “In other words, people who have had Covid-19 cannot assume they are protected against reinfection, even if they have been fully vaccinated. “Nevertheless, both previous infection with other variants and vaccination do seem to partially protect against severe disease and hospitalisation in those with Omicron. “This case also underscores the need to carry out genomic surveillance of viruses in infections in those who are fully vaccinated and in reinfections. “Such monitoring will help detect variants with the ability to partially evade the immune response.” Reinfections are the second or subsequent Covid-19 infections. Work by the Office for National Statistics suggests the risk of reinfection is 10 times higher with the Omicron variant compared with the Delta variant. Omicron is now the dominant variant in most of the world.

XE is known as a “recombinant” variant as it combines genetic characteristics of earlier Omicron variants BA.1 and BA.2. Early data suggests the emerging variant is more transmissible than previous forms of Omicron – all of which have been highly transmissible compared with earlier variants. A World Health Organisation report said XE appeared to have a growth rate 10 per cent higher than BA.2, for instance. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) had recorded 1,179 cases of XE by the time of its latest report on 5 April, up from 637 a fortnight earlier. The vast majority of cases were found in the south and east of England. While XE cases for other UK nations have not been reported, Northern Ireland’s Public Health Agency said it had detected a handful of cases. The number of cases broken down by English region is as follows: The UKHSA said there were 26 cases that could not be located to a region. An expert warned on Tuesday that XE is likely to become the dominant variant in the UK. The spread of the new variant and the wider state of the pandemic in Britain should be more clear after the new UKHSA report is released next week. Covid-19 cases have been declining across the UK since the end of March, though this is likely due to the end of free testing. Covid-19 cases have been declining across the UK since the end of March The number of people infected with the virus was estimated to have hit a record high around the time that free testing ended on 31 March. The Zoe Covid Study said 349,011 were then being infected each day. Three weeks on, the government recorded 21,393 cases on the latest available day. The Zoe study estimated there were more than 10 times that figure, at 227,702, on 18 April. By Zoe’s estimate, a total of 3.8 million people in the UK had Covid on 19 April, down from 4.6 million a fortnight earlier.

The New York City chapter of Extinction Rebellion (XR) disrupted the operations of The New York Times Company, News Corp and Gannet with the intention of targeting the Times and the Journal print runs, along with USA Today. “The purpose of today’s newspaper blockade is to draw the public’s attention to how mass media corporations like News Corp, The New York Times Company, and Gannet are failing to cover the climate emergency with the frequency it deserves, in some cases prioritizing the entertainment of subscribers,” Extinction Rebellion said, in a statement. The protest ended at 6.30am (EST) with 15 people arrested, Exctinction Rebellion NYC told The Independent. Other protests took place around the world on Earth Day, marked annually on 22nd April, including demonstrations against continued use of Russian fossil fuels in Europe. In the Western Ukrainian city of Lviv, which has been under missile strikes from Russian forces, protestors demonstrated with signs that said “embargo now,” Reuters reports. Police arrest an activist with Extinction Rebellion after the group protested at the New York Times printing press In Brussels, Warsaw and Berlin, protesters showed up at German government offices and embassy building. The country has not been in favor of an embargo of Russian oil and gas, Reuters notes. Greta Thunberg tweeted a photo of herself on Friday with fellow protesters on their weekly school strike to draw attention to the climate crisis.  “This is not a “happy earth day”. It never has been,” Ms Thunberg tweeted. “#EarthDay has turned into an opportunity for people in power to post their “love” for the planet, while at the same time destroying it at maximum speed.” Protestors in Bogota demonstrated against fracking projects planned in Colombia, AP reports. And in the Philippines, a climate group posted videos of people marching through the streets of Manila holding mock-ups of gravestones that said “1.5C is Dead” In Washington DC, the local chapter of XR unfurled a huge banner reading “No New Fossil Fuels” and set off flares at the offices of DC Mayor Muriel Bower and the city council. The World Health Organisation has called for fossil fuels to “stay in the ground” to prevent air pollution, noting how the climate crisis exacerbates human health burdens. Climate activist group Extinction Rebellion at a blockade in front of the New York Times printing plant in the Flushing neighborhood of Queens on April 22, 2022 The climate crisis is now front and center of many events. In the past year, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world’s most authoritative body on climate science, warned that global greenhouse gas emissions must start to decline by 2025, at the latest to prevent even more destructive impacts. In London, XR activists protested at the London office of asset management firm Vanguard, pushing for an immediate halt to European imports of Russian oil and gas, and an end to building fossil fuel infrastructure. Dozens of masked protesters lit flares which billowed pink smoke and set up deck chairs outside the company, holding signs reading “Vanguard, don’t sink our future”. Protesters hold a sign reading ‘Vanguard don’t sink our future\' XR’s Money Rebellion arm called on Vanguard to “stop pouring money into industries driving human rights abuses and start using your massive shareholdings to push for global climate action”. A spokesperson for Vanguard said: “We consider climate change to be a fundamental risk to many companies and their shareholders’ long-term financial success.” Separately, UK activists from group, Green New Deal, shared footage of their campaigners ambushing the business and energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, as he walked to his car asking why he “supports new gas and oil licenses”.  Mr Kwarteng did not respond but hours later welcomed BP’s announcement to develop the Murlach field oil and gas in the North Sea. Earth Day 2022’s focus is “Invest in our Planet” - encouraging individuals, businesses and world leaders to invest and switch to greener technologies and practices.

The 2022 event comes after the release of the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, which show the world is barrelling towards stronger, more frequent disasters fuelled by the climate crisis, with little time to reverse course. Extinction Rebellion said their activists had carried out a blockade at a printing works for major US newspapers early on Friday. The climate action group targeted a plant used by the New York Times and Wall Street Journal in the early hours of the morning. Extinction Rebellion activists march to the Wilson Building, the seat of DC’s local governance, for an Earth Day protest to ‘stop all new fossil fuel infrastructure in the nation’s capital\' Meanwhile other protests are planned around the world on Earth Day, including ones against Russian fossil fuels in Europe. Many other events are being held across the globe to celebrate the 52nd annual event, including other environmental protests, talks, film screenings and local litter picking events. Ms Thunberg is to publish a new book later this year featuring 100 leading experts and activists on climate change in a bid to present an overview of how the challenges facing the planet connect, telling “the unvarnished truth” about how and why the world is changing. The Climate Book will feature renowned scientists such as Johan Rockstrom, Michael Mann, Katherine Hayhoe, Friedrike Otto, Stefan Rahmstorf, Saleemul Huq and Carlos Nobre, as well as Thomas Piketty, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Naomi Klein, and Amitav Ghosh.

(616, '/climate-change/news/earth-day-books-about-climate-b2061900.html', 7, 'independent', 'Earth Day: Recommended reading lists from scientists and activists', 'The climate crisis is, in essence, a colossal, knotty problem that will take all of humanity’s innovation and ingenuity to untangle.  And where better to start fomenting on the dazzling numbers of ideas and plans that will be needed than with an inspiring pile of books. To mark Earth Day this Friday, scientists, global policy leaders and climate activists have shared with The Independent their go-to books in honor of Earth Day - and why they matter so much. Reading Emma Loewe’s Return To Nature is an antidote to burnout and a gentle invitation to expansive possibilities for awe, restoration, and gratitude right outside your front door. This gorgeously illustrated, beautifully written book invites you on an immersive journey through eight landscapes, combining fascinating insights into how nature restores our minds with accessible rituals to engage all your senses to experience and enjoy nature’s healing benefits for yourself. Along the way, you’ll learn simple but profound mindset shifts to appreciate our own role in the web of life, including solid practical advice on how we can better care for nature in our everyday lives as consumers and citizens, to protect and expand its gifts. I wrote Under The Sky We Make as a guide to finding your climate purpose. I wanted to give readers a set of principles and a guide, based on both scientific evidence and personal lived experience, to find ways to cope with overwhelming climate facts and feelings, and harness them to take meaningful action. Readers tell me that reading has helped them feel less alone, more able to face the news, and brought them closer to the people and places around them as they figure out how to align their values and actions at this critical moment for life on Earth.  I first came across the Ugandan activist, Vanessa Nakate, when she kickstarted a social media movement #SaveCongoRainforest to raise awareness to the risks the Congo basin forest is facing. As a Congolese environmentalist, I’ve been trying for years to draw the world’s attention to the world’s second largest rainforest, its importance (for climate, biodiversity and rainfall across Africa, as well as for the rights of Indigenous and local communities) and the threats it is facing. Vanessa got the world’s attention within months using just a hashtag and relentless passion. Her first book, A Bigger Picture, brings a strong, articulate, informed young African voice. Such voices need to be heard more consistently in the global conversation on the fate of our planet. Africa is the world’s youngest continent. It is also the continent that suffers most from the pillage of its natural treasures, in forests and in oceans, and is most impacted by the climate crisis. Vanessa’s book leaves me hopeful that our continent’s youth will carry out the green revolution that it needs. There are several books in the world today that tells us about the climate crisis, the solutions that exist and why climate action matters. But Stone Soup For A Sustainable World - Life-Changing Stories of Young Heroes (by Marianne Larned) includes the realities of the climate change crisis of young people from 100 countries and different continents. It says, “they appeal to our collective humanity. They are intelligent, resourceful, & committed to doing whatever it takes to wake people up to the climate crisis”. The Animal Lover’s Guide to Changing the World by Stephanie Feldstein is filled with easy, practical actions that anyone can take to live a more environmentally- and animal-friendly life. From everyday habits to how to create a campaign for change, this book helps readers better understand how they can affect the climate and wildlife. It also features fascinating facts about wildlife that help connect us to the other species that share our world. A book filled with practical and simple actions is both empowering and necessary as we face the climate and extinction crises. And in an age of climate anxiety, Feldstein makes activism accessible without the guilt trip. It’s an important read for aspiring advocates of any age. The Book of Hope,  by Jane Goodall and Douglas Abrams, an honest account of the devastating threats of climate and other global challenges, is also inspiring action to move forward and contribute to solutions. It describes a circularity of hope and action: the key to hope is to recognize challenges, while envisioning the future we want. Jane recalls her first journey to Africa in the 1950s. Since she was trained as a secretary and not a scientist, her greatest strengths were her adventurous spirit and perception of the natural world without biases. Approaching 90 years old, Jane now has an invaluable perspective that it is not too late, but we must act with far greater ambition. Throughout our lifetime, nature has been extensively degraded, a process which is attributed in the book to a fundamental lack of compassion for future generations and a lack of education and poverty. Having gone so far, nature cannot merely be protected, the restoration of ecosystems is an imperative of our age.  The Independent has launched an exclusive Climate Warrior bulletin, written by activists.

It was, for lack of a better phrase, a dumping ground. Though far from pristine farmland, Mr Hillery knew that he could grow something in the space.  In the 11 years since Mr Hillery began working on the site, he and members of his organisation, Harlem Grown, have transformed the land, and several other spots across the borough.  The volunteer-driven project has now created a network of thriving urban farms that aim to teach and empower local children while combatting food insecurity. Harlem Grown currently operates 12 agricultural sites and maintains partnerships with five Harlem school districts.  The Independent has partnered with Harlem Grown to celebrate the organisation’s achievements and to mark Earth Day on 22nd April. Staff from The Independent will join Harlem Grown in May to volunteer their time at the farms. Those who wish to join The Independent in its support for Harlem Grown, can donate to the organisation through its website. Harlem Grown is not your typical community garden. Rather than sectioning off plots of land to individual gardeners, the project invites its elementary school “farmers” and their families to work together to grow a variety of crops during Saturday workshops.  A Harlem Grown staff member works with a student at the community garden In addition to teaching sessions and working the farm, which includes watering crops, pulling up weeds and caring for mushrooms, Harlem Grown also provides storytime, cooking demos, and lunch. The weekend sessions run from April to October. In summer, the organisation also offers a free, seven-week intensive Summer Camp at the urban farm.  The yield from the students\' labour is not only collected for distribution to those in need in the community, but also used to help teach the children healthy eating habits.  \"We plant fruits and vegetables, but we grow healthy children and sustainable communities,” Mr Hillery said.  The organisation focuses on children who are just starting elementary school, the founder and CEO says. He believes that using Harlem Grown\'s \"living classrooms\" to instill good habits - like healthy eating and sustainability - in early childhood will ensure those habits continue as students grow up. A child works on a raised plant bed at Harlem Grown Many students participating in the program come from low-income backgrounds, and Harlem Grown is often their only access to extracurricular education and fresh, organic produce.  The non-profit estimates that 98 per cent of the students that attend are part of the federal supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP), some 90 per cent live below the poverty line, and 40 per cent live in homeless shelters.  The organisation has been successful at serving these students, their families, and the wider neighborhood. Last year, Harlem Grown engaged with more than 1,000 students at in-person programs, and another 8,877 young people online.  The organisation held 18 farm tours, during which participants learned about sustainability, nutrition, and urban agriculture.  Harlem Grown also operates a Mobile Teaching Kitchen. The van parks up in different parts of Harlem and volunteers offer cooking lessons, and share ideas on recipes and ingredients. The test kitchen served more than 1,000 community members last year, and provided 69,044 servings of food in 2021.

The award is in recognition of the environmentalist’s commitment to sharing stories about the natural world and climate change, according to the BBC. In comments carried by the broadcaster, Sir David urged action to prevent further destruction of the planet. “Fifty years ago, whales were on the very edge of extinction worldwide. Then people got together and now there are more whales in the sea than any living human being has ever seen,” the 95-year-old said. “We know what the problems are and we know how to solve them. All we lack is unified action.” UNEP executive director Inger Anderson paid tribute to Sir David, saying: “If we stand a chance of averting climate and biodiversity breakdowns and cleaning up polluted ecosystems, it’s because millions of us fell in love with the planet that he captured on film and writing, in his voice.” Previous recipients of the award include Barbados prime minister Mia Mottley and charity SeaWomen of Melanesia. Ahead of last year’s Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, Sir David called for “bold action” and support for local communities and landowners so they can create connected wild places on land and at sea to protect humanity.

Flying less, eating a more sustainable diet and limiting waste are all good for reducing your footprint on the world. But with all due respect to Kermit the Frog, greening your whole life isn’t necessarily that easy. In a world built around fossil fuels, it’s much harder to opt out of pollution and emissions than it is to opt in. But here’s what is possible: pressuring your government, political leaders and public officials to making sweeping changes on climate, from city infrastructure to national energy policy. So rather than, say, trying to eliminate every scrap of plastic from your life, take action that has transformative possibilities - on Earth Day, or any other day. Start with an email (or old school pen and paper) and write to your local representative in state, regional, provincial or federal government about what concerns you, or what you’re passionate about. Being specific often has greater impact, like encouraging your representative to vote in a certain way on a proposed piece of legislation, for example, or sharing your opinions on a policy matter. In the UK, climate charity Hope for the Future has created letter templates for getting in touch with your MP to discuss the climate crisis, set up a meeting or invite them to a climate event. In the US, the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists offers customisable letters addressed to the president, the Environmental Protection Agency and members of Congress on everything from extreme heat to electric vehicles. Asking politely via email is one thing – but you can also take to the streets to demand that leaders sit up and take notice.  Along with grabbing the attention of public officials, protests drive community awareness on issues. Any large demonstration is typically accompanied by a fair number of gawkers — but also people who will ask questions or even join in — adding more fuel to the engine of change. To find out how to get involved, check out the local chapters of environmental groups for details on in-person events. If you aren’t sure which group works best for you, check out different groups’ messaging on their own websites and what they’ve had to say on social media and in broader media coverage. Community action doesn’t have to be all about protests. It can be as impactful to lay the groundwork for social movements by talking with your family, friends and neighbours. Start with some research. If you’re looking to brush up on the basics, the Climate Reality Project has an accessible guide to the who, what, where, when and why of the climate crisis. For a deeper dive into the science, Nasa offers fact sheets, videos and quizzes — along with resources for kids to engage with topics. If you’d rather learn from the comfort of your couch, hundreds of climate and nature documentaries can be streamed for free on WaterBear, the first environmentally-focused service of its kind. And if you want to maximize your commute, the array of climate podcasts grows by the day, with increasingly niche takes on everything from energy policy to wildlife conservation to local climate stories. Among the plethora of examples: the former Irish President Mary Robinson and comedian Maeve Higgins offer a feminist take on women’s roles in climate justice on Mothers of Invention. How to Save a Planet, with marine biologist Dr Ayana Elizabeth Johnson and journalist Alex Blumberg, is packed with everyday fixes to climate queries. For the truly detail-oriented, there’s Volts, where journalist David Roberts explores big ideas on the nitty-gritty of climate science and policy. And if you want to make a mental visit to the American Southwest, listen to Boomtown, a podcast about the fossil fuel industry in West Texas.  All climate change is local, and zoning in your focus here can have a transformative impact. Local councils and regulators are often the ones with the decision-making power to make relatively rapid changes — on everything from bike lanes to increasing electric public transport to setting sustainability standards for local businesses — compared to legislation that can take years at the national level.

And from plastic pollution to biodiversity collapse to the climate crisis, there’s no shortage of issues to tackle. This global environmental holiday, which occurs every year on 22 April, is celebrated by an estimated 1 billion people, per EarthDay.org – from schoolkids to heads of state. The day is meant to serve both as a reminder of the threats to our planet and a chance to appreciate everything the Earth offers. Here’s what you need to know about the day’s history and how to participate. This year, and every year, Earth Day is on 22 April. In recent years, Earth Day celebrations have stretched out over the entire week containing Earth Day, and even the entire month of April. EarthDay.org lists a variety of events — both online and in-person around the world — taking place across the entire month. Earth Day is a global annual event intended to prompt discussion and action around environmental causes. This year’s theme is “Invest In Our Planet”, encouraging individuals, businesses and governments to invest in technologies and practices that can benefit the Earth. In 2022, Earth Day comes after the release of the latest IPCC reports showing that the world is barrelling towards stronger, more frequent disastersfuelled by the climate crisis, with little time to reverse course. According to EarthDay.org, the initial idea for Earth Day came on the heels of a 1969 oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara, California. In response to that disaster, they say, US Senator Gaylord Nelson wanted to catalyse environmental activism along the lines of the movement opposing the Vietnam War. Those organising efforts led to the first Earth Day in 1970 — which saw 20 million people across the US participating — around 10 per cent of the country’s population at the time, reports EarthDay.org. Within a year, the organisation points out, US President Richard Nixon had created the Environmental Protection Agency — a new branch of the federal government. The first Earth Day also preceded a wave of environmental legislation passed in the US in the early 1970s, including the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act and Endangered Species Act, they note. Earth Day became an international campaign in 1990, according to the organisation, spreading to 141 countries, and by 2000, the annual event had reached nearly every corner of the globe. In recent years, the day has become something of a yearly milestone for the global environmental movement. In 2016, the historic Paris Agreement started gathering signatory countries on Earth Day, for example. The international pact aims to limit global warming to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial levels. Earth Day in 2022 will feature events hosted around the world. EarthDay.org has a list of events taking place this month, both in-person and online, as well as a variety of suggestions for ways to get involved. Local governments and organisations are also planning their own events. For example, New York City is closing off streets on the Saturday following Earth Day to get people walking and biking in the city. And in St. Louis, Missouri, people can go to the Earth Day Festival on 23 and 24 April. In addition, all across the United States, the National Parks Service is hosting both in-person and virtual events to mark “National Parks Week,” which coincides with Earth Day on Friday. Some political leaders will also mark the day, such as US President Biden, who will be in Seattle, Washington to speak about clean energy, according to the Seattle Times. It may be worth looking at your local newspapers and city governments, as well as institutions like libraries, museums and parks to see what’s happening near you. In addition, people can always plan their own ways of celebrating Earth Day — and EarthDay.org has a list of recommendations, including everything from picking up trash to educating yourself about environmental issues to lobbying members of government for more system-wide change.

(621, '/climate-change/sustainable-living/if-you-can-t-beat-them-eat-them-the-chef-plating-up-invasive-spec', 7, 'independent', 'If you can’t beat them, eat them: How one chef is plating up invasive species', 'Utter the words “Japanese knotweed” to a homeowner and all the blood is likely to drain from their face. They may break into a cold sweat, eyes darting around frantically as they grab your shoulders and shake you, shouting: “WHERE??” The notorious weed was first introduced into the UK by German-British botanist Philipp von Siebold in the 19th century as an ornamental plant, for its large, heart-shaped green leaves and hollow stems, with clusters of small white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its import proved to be disastrous. ​​Without the checks and balances of its native land that kept it under control, the knotweed thrived in the UK, growing stronger, larger and more fiercely. The fast-growing plant can wreak havoc on a home, growing Jumanji-style under fences and between cracks in walls and patios. Even a small thumb-sized piece of its rhizomes, underground stems that grow horizontally, could sprout a whole new plant that can exert enough pressure on concrete to gradually prize it apart. The weed is so problematic that it can devalue a property by as much as 15 per cent or, in some rare cases, completely. Removing it is no mean feat either, and can cost as much as £10,000. Its fast-growing nature also affects ecosystems by crowding out native vegetation, which limits plant and animal species diversity. Today, there is barely a corner of the country that is untouched by Japanese knotweed, save for the Highlands. So fearsome is Japanese knotweed that seeing its name on a restaurant menu may send chills down the spines of anyone who owns or deals with property in the UK. But I’m about to tuck into two spears of the stuff in zero waste restaurant Silo, Hackney Wick – perhaps the only place in London where it may be conceivable to do so. The shoots of Japanese knotweed look like sinister asparagus. They have the same thick stem that tapers into the shape of a spear, but instead of the rubber-soft clusters we know and love, the tips of Japanese knotweed shoots appear distinctly spiky. The reddish-green hue doesn’t do it any favours either. But when grilled and served alongside a salad of brassica and a cured egg yolk, Japanese knotweed takes on a more unsuspecting appearance. It is tender and tart, often compared to rhubarb in flavour but with more versatility, suiting both savoury and sweet dishes. Japanese knotweed served with brassica salad and a cured egg yolk at Silo, Hackney Wick Chef Doug McMaster, who founded Silo a decade ago this month, wants to show people a different side to Japanese knotweed and other invasive species such as grey squirrel, American signal crayfish, Japanese wireweed and pennywort. All invasive species that outcompete native animals and plants have a disastrous effect on the ecosystem. Grey squirrels breed quickly and bully their native red counterparts out of their territory, as well as spread a squirrelpox virus that is fatal to the latter, but not the former. American signal crayfish proliferate in the UK’s river systems, eradicating native plants, small invertebrates and fish wherever they go. What I’m trying to propose with this event is that we find a greater balance and harmony within the ecosystem There are established methods to control these species. For pests, control strategies often involve trapping or hunting, contraception to stop them breeding and natural predation. McMaster takes a different approach: “If you can’t beat ’em, eat ’em.” “It’s a radical act of sustainability, that’s how I see it,” he tells The Independent. “Not only are we eating the problem, but we are also mitigating the energy and resources that would have been wasted if we let it go to waste.” He points towards what he calls a “trophic cascade” of environmental damage caused by invasive species as the main reason Britons should consider eating them. Squirrel kofte with black ketchup and chicken neck garum at Silo, Hackney Wick “They are reproducing and destroying environments that other species can’t live without, which causes entire ecosystems to crash and it’s a type of devastation that we often don’t see,” he says. “What I’m trying to propose with this event is that we find a greater balance and harmony within the ecosystem. That’s extreme sustainability and should be a positive thing no matter which way you look at it.” The chef, who was named Great Britain’s best young chef in 2009, has dreamed up a dizzying array of ways to serve up the pests, such as a grey squirrel kofte, with black ketchup and chicken neck garum. The meat is tender and juicy, almost porky in flavour. The rodent is also used to make a rich broth, balanced with tangy pickled knotweed to wake up the tongue. A lion’s mane mushroom swimming in signal crayfish bisque almost has me licking the plate, while a creamy sauce made from hogweed that accompanies a cut of velvety venison is a revelation. And who would’ve known that Japanese knotweed compote would go so well with panela ice cream? One can only expect the unexpected with McMaster’s invasive dinner series. Lion’s mane mushroom in signal crayfish bisque at Silo, Hackney Wick Eating invasive species seems like a no-brainer. After all, eating invasive species is not a new concept in many other parts of the world. Even in the UK, it’s not so uncommon to consume grey squirrel in some parts of the countryside. In Cumbria, where former Masterchef contestant Kevin Tickle grew up, eating grey squirrels was a relatively normal part of life. He used to run Forest Side Restaurant in Ambleside, where he served customers The Little Critter Fritter, a croquette that combined pork, rabbit and grey squirrel. “Personally, I do a lot of grey squirrel control because you get a lot of them up here,” he says. This is a gross understatement – grey squirrels are driving their native counterparts in the area to extinction, so much so that the red rodents are afforded the highest level of protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act. “It’s never occurred to me that it might be unusual to eat invasive species, but I think it is important for city people to be better educated on their impact. It might be more commonplace to have squirrel on the table at some point in the future.” Eating it would be like bringing a dustpan and brush to the aftermath of an earthquake... The ship has already sailed But could eating invasive species really help reduce their population numbers, and if so, why aren’t we doing it? The answer isn’t so simple. Kay Pemberton, an expert on Japanese knotweed, tells The Independent that the plant is largely spread “through ignorance or illegal distribution”. This is due to people not realising they have Japanese knotweed in their soil, digging it up and dispersing it elsewhere, or some who purposefully get rid of contaminated soil by fly-tipping or hiding it in skips. She thinks that while the idea of consuming invasive species such as Japanese knotweed is interesting, it’s unlikely to become a widespread practice and really depends on which species you’re eating. In the case of Japanese knotweed, farmers “wouldn’t go near the stuff” because of how easily it can run riot, and an ordinary person would need a waste carrier licence in order to forage for it, because the plant is classed as “controlled waste”. Venison with hogweed sauce and mustard greens at Silo, Hackney Wick “I think that eating it would be like bringing a dustpan and brush to the aftermath of an earthquake,” Pemberton says. “The ship has already sailed; it won’t help to control or reduce the population. I truly believe that the only way to control it in a considered, appropriate manner, is herbicide treatment. “Even if you eat it, the rhizomes will still remain. You can cut a shoot off, but the knotweed will keep growing more shoots; it won’t stop it from living. It could only be a food source for three to four weeks out of a year, as it becomes unpalatable beyond the early growing stages.” There is also the risk that putting invasive species on menus could downplay how dangerous they are for the native environment. Professor Helen Roy, an ecologist who specialises in the dynamics of invasive species and their effects on biodiversity and ecosystems, says that the environmental impact of consuming such species would be minimal. Japanese knotweed compote with panela ice cream and rose at Silo, Hackney Wick “I think there would be concerns that this could somehow create a market for these invasive non-native species and so send confusing messages about the huge threat that is posed by the environmental issue of biological invasions,” she tells The Independent. “Of course people all around the world are living alongside invasive alien species and in some cases eating them but it would be far preferable to reduce the threat of biological invasions through enhanced biosecurity and prevention.” However, McMaster is still hopeful that his dinner series will start further conversation about how consuming non-native species that pose a danger to British ecosystems could be viable – or at the very least, palatable. And people are interested. “Tickets flew out. We sold out in two hours; the level of interest has been pretty overwhelming,” he says. “The amount of energy going into these dinners is extraordinary: we’ve probably spent 200 hours on this labour of love. But Silo doesn’t exist to make a profit, we’re here to change the world. It sounds hyperbolic, but we genuinely care and want to make a difference and talk about these things that no one else will… We’re doing our best.” Food waste is a huge global problem, with millions of tonnes of food being thrown away every year, accounting for eight to 10 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. The Independent’s series, The Clean Plate Club, explores what can be done about food waste as the world continues to face up to the climate crisis.

(622, '/climate-change/infact/what-is-soil-degradation-and-why-is-it-important-b2060650.html', 7, 'independent', 'What is soil degradation and why is it important?', 'Soil supports agriculture, wildlife, filters water, and stores carbon. The American farmer and poet Wendell Berry once said: “Soil is the great connector of lives, the source and destination of all. It is the healer and restorer and resurrector, by which disease passes into health, age into youth, death into life. “Without proper care for it we can have no community, because without proper care for it we can have no life.” Soil degradation is a huge climate issue that does not get the same public recognition as green issues like rising temperatures, flooding, and air quality. Soil degradation involves both the physical loss (erosion) and the reduction in quality of topsoil associated with nutrient decline and contamination. It affects soil quality for agriculture and has implications for the urban environment, pollution, and flooding. A total of 2.2 million tonnes of topsoil is eroded annually in the UK and over 17% of arable land shows signs of erosion, according to the Environment Agency. And the Save Soil movement says 52% of the world’s agricultural soil is already dead and 90% of the earth’s soil will be degraded by 2050. Globally, more than half of all soils are now classified as degraded, with approximately 1.5 billion people living on degraded land, claims the Sustainable Food Trust. This damage, the organisation says, is largely the result of industrial farming practices, over-grazing and global warming and generates an enormous hidden cost to society.  It can be the result of one or more of several factors. Soil degradation is a natural process but can be caused by human activity such as intensive farming practices like deforestation, overgrazing, intensive cultivation, forest fires, and construction work. These actions disturb soil and leave it vulnerable to wind and water erosion, which damages the complex systems underneath, says Silvia Pressel, a Natural History Museum researcher in the Algae, Fungi and Plants Division. “Several practices associated with intensive agriculture, especially tilling, disrupt soil structure,” she said. “They accelerate surface runoff and soil erosion, loss of organic matter and fertility and disruption in cycles of water, organic carbon and plant nutrients. “These practices also have a major negative impact on soil biodiversity. “When soil degrades, the processes that take place within it are damaged. This causes a decline in soil health, biodiversity and productivity, leading to issues at all levels of many ecosystems, and resulting in large environmental consequences such as floods and mass migration.” A UN-backed report has warned that globally more than 3.2 billion people are already affected by soil degradation, and this is driving migration and conflict. According to Save Soil, in 20 years, 40% less food is expected to be produced for 9.3 billion people as poor soil leads to poor nutritional value. Today’s fruits and vegetables already contain 90% fewer nutrients and an estimated two billion people suffer from nutritional deficiencies leading to multitude of diseases, the organisation adds. Furthermore, soil degradation increases the chance of flooding, as soils that have lost organic matter cannot absorb and retain substantial amounts of water. The annual cost of soil degradation overall has been estimated at between $6.3 trillion and $10.6 trillion. And because degraded soils cannot retain moisture to the same degree as soils rich in organic matter, they are also vulnerable to droughts, according to the Sustainable Food Trust. Head of communication Megan Perry said: “With major droughts seen in recent years from California to Argentina to Cape Town, and even the UK periodically, this is something which urgently needs addressing before food shortages and environmental damage become endemic. “Soil stores 2,500 billion metric tonnes of carbon, almost twice as much as in the atmosphere and over four times the 560 billion tonnes found in plants and animals. So, our top priority has to be to stop further soil degradation and keep all that carbon in the soil. But most cropland has already lost between 40-60% of its organic carbon to the atmosphere.” She adds: “To reverse this, real systemic change is required in the way land is managed. A return to mixed farming – integrating crop production with grassland and grazing livestock, along with deeper rooting plants and returning organic waste to farmland ideally through compost – is essential to rebuild soil fertility and organic carbon levels. For every 1% increase in soil organic matter, the first foot of soil is able to hold an additional 16,500 gallons of water per acre.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(623, '/climate-change/infact/nigel-farage-vote-power-not-poverty-climate-net-zero-b2057960.html', 7, 'independent', 'What is Nigel Farage’s ‘Vote Power, Not Poverty’ group?', 'Now Brexit has been achieved – to questionable success – Nigel Farage has turned his ire on climate change. The 58-year-old GB News host and former Brexit Party leader has launched an organisation called ‘Vote Power, Not Poverty’ with the aim of forcing a referendum on the UK Government’s Net Zero plans. What are the aims of Vote Power, Not Poverty? And how do Farage and his supporters hope to achieve them? The UK has made a commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050. In October the government released a UK Net Zero Strategy to set out how British businesses and consumers will be supported in making the transition to clean energy and green technology, with the aim of lowering Britain’s reliance on fossil fuels by investing in sustainable clean energy in the UK. It follows a series of landmark reports from the world’s leading authority on the climate crisis, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The reports, compiled by the world’s leading climate experts, describe how the climate crisis is a threat to human wellbeing and the health of the planet, and calls for urgent, transformative action to secure humanity’s future. According to the organisation’s website: “Our aim is simple. We are demanding a referendum on the life-changing Net Zero plans forced upon us by Westminster politicians. “We all care about the environment and want cleaner air. We all want to do our bit. But Westminster’s Net Zero is the wrong bit, at the wrong price, in the wrong timeframe. “Our aim is to galvanise the great British public into pushing back against a Net Zero agenda that will destroy British jobs, whilst making us poorer and colder.” Experts have denounced it as “disingenuous” and economically illiterate. When pushed on concrete details about its aims by the Independent’s Donnachadh McCarthy, the organisation was silent. And climate reporter Zoe Tidman analysed how the cost of slashing emissions will not come cheap but – even just in financial terms – the price of unabated global warming will likely be far higher. Farage cancelled the launch of his new campaign against net zero after a second venue pulled out of hosting it. Organisers of the Vote Power Not Poverty rally said “a wave of abuse, threats and intimidation” had led them to scrap the event, which had been scheduled to take place in Bolton last month. The launch of the campaign, which is calling for a referendum on the government’s pledge to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, was originally due to be held at Bolton Wanderers’ stadium but the football club pulled out amid a fan backlash. The rally was set to be relocated to 3D Centre, a wedding and function space, but campaign organisers told The Independent on Monday they had cancelled the event entirely after that venue also pulled out. “The amount of intimidation the owner was under became impossible,” a spokesman for the campaign told The Independent. “It’s even worse than Brexit.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(624, '/news/ap-olive-hudson-river-nyc-willy-wonka-b2062439.html', 7, 'independent', 'NYC reservoir releases raise worries about stormier future', ' As western regions contend with drier conditions, New York City is under fire for sometimes releasing hundreds of millions of gallons of water a day from a key reservoir in the Catskill Mountains. The occasional releases, often around storms, have been used to manage water levels in the Ashokan Reservoir and to keep the water clear. But residents downstream say the periodic surges cause ecological harm along the lower Esopus Creek. They say the high flows churn up the water so much it turns the scenic Hudson River tributary into the color of chocolate milk. “These people can afford to offer New York City cheap, clean, beautiful water by destroying ours,” said Michael Vallarella, who lives on the creek in Saugerties. Standing on his back deck recently, he swiped through pictures on his phone of the water looking like “Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory river.” The tensions between upstate residents and the city of 8.8 million people to the south touch on how the largest unfiltered water supply in the country will operate in an expected stormier future. Opponents pushing for changes to the water releases got a boost recently when state regulators told the city to take a deeper look at their effects. City officials say they’re trying to strike the difficult balance of responding to downstream concerns while delivering quality water. “If there was an easy solution to all this that could satisfy everyone’s concerns, including ours, we’d be happy to do it,” said Paul Rush, deputy commissioner for the city’s Department of Environmental Protection. “But this is a really difficult problem.” The Ashokan Reservoir sits by rolling mountains 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of Manhattan and is the second largest of city’s 19 reservoirs. It was created more than a century ago by damming the Esopus Creek, displacing low-lying communities and seeding long-lasting local resentments over issues like watershed land-use restrictions. The current controversy revolves around interim rules that allow large water releases — up to 600 million gallons a day — from the Ashokan through a channel that links to the lower Esopus. Largely dormant until 2006, the channel helps regulate reservoir levels to mitigate flooding downstream, such as when big storms hit. The channel also has been used to get rid of water that is turbid — that is, cloudy with suspended particles — before it heads south to city faucets. The city is seeking permission from the state Department of Environmental Conservation to keep making the two types of releases, along with smaller daily releases that help maintain the creek’s flow. Opponents are seeking changes. Turbidity can be an issue with Ashokan water due to silty water flowing in. The reservoir was designed to give suspended particles time to settle in a western basin before flowing into a clearer eastern basin. But sometimes more needs to be done. The city had been using the chemical alum to reduce turbidity, but was required to limit its use in 2005. The city says larger Ashokan releases over the past decade have all been to regulate reservoir levels, though critics say the water released after storms can be turbid just the same. City environmental officials contend they\'re blamed too much for murkiness in the lower creek, saying it also flows in from other sources. The agency said in its environmental analysis they anticipated no significant adverse impacts to the lower Esopus under the releases. Critics counter that the periodic high-volume, long-lasting releases erode banks, leave deposits and harm fish habitats on the 33-mile Hudson River tributary. Many feel the city is not being held to the same standard it applies to residents near their reservoirs. “There’s a very different way of operating for the City of New York when it’s the watershed lands and the streams draining into the reservoir versus the downstream system,” said Amanda LaValle, deputy director of the Ulster County Planning Department. Locals fear major releases will become more common as extreme storms increase. They point to the large storm and snow melt in December 2020 that preceded major releases over several months during which the lower Esopus often ran brown. Seven municipalities that draw drinking water from the Hudson River said those releases taxed their water filtration systems. The pair of water releases came shortly after the city issued its environmental impact statement projecting that releases of extremely turbid water from the channel would rarely happen. “The 2020 storm hit and it contradicted their projections,” said Mary McNamara of the Lower Esopus Watershed Partnership. “That’s why people say their climate change projections are not aggressive enough.” State environmental regulators cited the storm in telling the city this year to perform a supplemental environmental analysis. Among other things, the city must look at the effects of the releases on the Hudson River water supplies and determine whether more climate change analysis is needed. The city had already projected that a 5% increase in precipitation is possible by mid-century, though with far less snow. Rush, of the city environmental protection department, said the expectation of increased precipitation mixed in with dry spells “is going to be a big challenge.” He said the city is open to adjustments in how they operate the Ashokan, noting they already have the flexibility to rely on two other upstate watersheds. The city has permission to use alum this fall when work on a tunnel under the Hudson River will require the temporary disconnection of the aqueduct for the neighboring Delaware watershed. Rush said alum use could be studied as a longer-term solution. Some upstate officials say the releases could be modified to mix in more clear water or to increase the daily flow as a way to avoid dramatic ramp ups in water flowing down the creek. Also in the mix are engineering solutions, such as crest gates that would allow the capacity of the Ashokan\'s western basin. “We’re looking for ways to really work together,” LaValle said.

(625, '/climate-change/news/britain-flooding-2050-cardiff-london-b2058174.html', 7, 'independent', 'The 10 UK areas most at risk of flooding due to climate crisis ', 'Cardiff, Windsor and parts of London will be among the local authorities most at risk of flooding by 2050 when factoring in the climate crisis, according to new data shared exclusively with The Independent. The new research by Bristol-based flood-mapping business, Fathom, is based on the first model to use climate crisis data to predict which areas will be the most at risk of flooding due to rivers or heavy rainfall (non-costal) in Great Britain by mid-century. The 10 local authorities expected to be at risk are listed below. The percentages, measured against the previous assessment made in 2020, indicate the proportion of properties at risk of non-coastal flooding in any given year.  The model defines risk as having a greater than 1 per cent chance of non-costal flooding in any given year, a standard measure, according to Fathom. The new research finds that while there are around 1.09 million properties across Great Britain currently at risk of flooding, by mid-century this will rise to 1.35 million, an increase of nearly 25 per cent. Towns in England and Wales - including Ironbridge in Shropshire - were hit by flooding during storms earlier this year However, this also means that around 75 per cent of the properties at risk by 2050 are already at risk today, according to Professor Paul Bates, Chair of Hydrology at the University of Bristol and co-founder of Fathom. Nine out of 10 of the local authority areas are on the most recent list of the 10 areas with the highest risk of flooding, although there are some changes in their ranking. Only Clackmannanshire in Scotland was not on the 2020 list, while Denbighshire in Wales was. That is not surprising, according to Dr Bates, because the climate emergency is more likely to exacerbate flooding in current flood-prone areas rather than putting entirely new places at risk. “There is often this narrative in flooding that we’re going to have disastrous floods in the future,” Dr Bates told The Independent. “That implicitly suggests that we’ve got the problem under control now, which we really don’t.” “Yes, climate change does increase flood risk in most parts of the country, but actually most of the risk is already here with us today,” he added. “If we dealt with the now better, we’d put ourselves in a much better place to deal with climate change.” The Boat Inn at Jackfield is marooned by flood water from the River Severn after successive storms hit the UK on 22 February 2022 in Ironbridge, England If you look at the places in Great Britain that are mostly at risk, South Wales and places along major rivers are most noticeable, but flood risk is everywhere and depends strongly on local geography, according to Dr Bates. He added that the data suggests a notable jump in the risk in Neath Port Talbot, and this is because of the number of properties in the region currently just on the edge of flood risk zones that will be brought into the flood plain. While flooding is expected to increase in most parts of Great Britain, there are some areas, such as Lincolnshire, where inland flooding will actually decrease, according to the data. “We see this pattern because of the complex interplay between increasing rainfall and warmer temperatures,” said Dr Bates. “In some eastern counties warmer temperatures mean drier soils at some times of year, so even though rainfall increases it doesn’t necessarily lead to more flooding.” In order to address future flood risk due to the climate crisis, Dr Bates said Britain needed to deal better with the risks the country faces today. One way to achieve this, he said, would be by making properties that regularly flood more resilient so they are better able to cope. Tangible examples include installing tiled floors rather than carpet, moving electrical sockets up the walls above the flood line, floodproof doors and toilet bungs. Investment in flood defences and warning systems would also help, as would no more developments on floodplains, he added. The publication of the data comes as Flood Re, a joint initiative between the government and UK insurance industry to promote availability and affordability of flood insurance, launches a new scheme this month to ensure homes are more resilient against future flooding.  From 20 April, participating insurers will begin offering customers access to reimbursement costs of up to £10,000, over and above work to repair damage and loss caused by a flood. The funds will pay for the installation of flood resilience measures, such as raising electrical sockets, which will reduce the impact of future flooding.

The Biden administration is revising how the National Environmental Policy Act is implemented.  President Trump overhauled the act, known as NEPA, in 2020. The Nixon-era legisation is one of the country’s landmark environmental laws which low-income and minority communities have used for decades to fight back against potential polluters. On Tuesday, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) announced it was restoring three elements of NEPA which include “a reaffirmation that Federal agencies must evaluate all relevant environmental impacts – including those associated with climate change – during environmental reviews”. “Restoring these basic community safeguards will provide regulatory certainty, reduce conflict, and help ensure that projects get built right the first time,” said CEQ Chair Brenda Mallory.  “Patching these holes in the environmental review process will help projects get built faster, be more resilient, and provide greater benefits– to people who live nearby.” Before changes made by the Trump administration, NEPA instructed federal agencies to take into account environmental impacts before signing off on infrastructure projects, and sought public comment before issuing permits.  The changes by the last administration limited public input and set strict deadlines of up to two years to complete environmental studies. It also allowed federal agencies to rule out environmental assessments on some projects entirely, and void considerations of how infrastructure plans would impact the climate crisis.  The rule also meant that the “cumulative” effects of a project on the environment would no longer be considered, and it would be reviewed in a silo from existing polluting forces in an area. NEPA has given environmental activists and communities the opportunity to challenge projects, often mounting legal battles. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe used NEPA to mount a legal challenge against the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). In the Atlantic coastal town of Arecibo, Puerto Rico, residents used NEPA’s safeguards to halt a waste-to-energy incinerator from operating in an area which already suffers contamination from heavy metals. Minority and low-income communities disproportionately bear the brunt of pollution and the climate emergency.  Some 68 per cent of Black households and more than a third of Latinos live within 30 miles of a coal-fired power plant, according to GreenAmerica.org, making them more likely to suffer health impacts of pollution like breathing issues and heart conditions.

(627, '/news/world/americas/arizona-ap-flagstaff-new-mexico-navajo-nation-b2061287.html', 7, 'independent', '\'Wall of fire\' forces evacuations near Arizona tourist town', ' Heavy winds kicked up a towering wall of flames outside a northern Arizona tourist town Tuesday, ripping through two-dozen structures and sending residents of more than 700 homes scrambling to flee. Flames as high as 100 feet (30 meters) raced through an area of scattered homes, dry grass and Ponderosa pine trees on the outskirts of Flagstaff as wind gusts of up to 50 mph (80 kph) pushed the blaze over a major highway.  Coconino County officials said during an evening news conference that 766 homes and 1,000 animals had been evacuated. About 250 structures remained threatened in the area popular with hikers and off-road vehicle users and where astronauts have trained amid volcanic cinder pits. The county declared an emergency after the wildfire ballooned from 100 acres (40 hectares) Tuesday morning to over 9 square miles (23 square kilometers) by evening, and ash rained from the sky. The fire was moving northeast away from the more heavily populated areas of Flagstaff, home to Northern Arizona University, and toward Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument, said Coconino National Forest spokesman Brady Smith. “It’s good in that it’s not headed toward a very populated area, and it’s headed toward less fuel,” Smith said. “But depending on the intensity of the fire, fire can still move across cinders.” Authorities won’t be able to determine whether anyone was injured in the wildfire until the flames subside. Firefighters and law enforcement officers went door to door telling people to evacuate but had to pull out to avoid getting boxed in, said Coconino County Sheriff Jim Driscoll. He said his office got a call about a man who was trapped inside his house, but firefighters couldn’t get to him.  “We don’t know if he made it out or not,” Driscoll said. Various organizations worked to set up shelters for evacuees and animals, including goats and horses. The scene was all too familiar for residents who recalled rushing to pack their bags and flee a dozen years ago when a much larger wildfire burned in the same area. “This time was different, right there in your backyard,” said Kathy Vollmer, a resident.  She said she and her husband grabbed their three dogs but left a couple of cats behind as they faced what she described as a “wall of fire.” “We just hope they are going to be OK,\" she said. Earlier in the day, the wildfire shut down U.S. 89, the main route between Flagstaff and far northern Arizona, and communities on the Navajo Nation. The high winds grounded aircraft that could drop water and fire retardant on the blaze. Arizona Public Service Co., the state\'s largest utility, shut off power to about 625 customers to keep firefighters safe, a spokeswoman said. About 200 firefighters were battling the flames, but more are expected as a top-level national management team takes over later this week.  The fire started Sunday afternoon 14 miles (22 kilometers) northeast of Flagstaff. Investigators don’t know yet what caused it and have yet to corral any part of the blaze. Ali Taranto rushed to Flagstaff from Winslow, where she works at a hospital, on Tuesday to check on a property she owns that was threatened by the wildfire. She also was getting messages to check on a neighbor who she found didn’t have access to oxygen while the power was out and didn’t have the strength to manually open her garage door to evacuate. Taranto said the neighbor was “disoriented and gasping for air” when she reached her. Firefighters in the area helped get the garage door open and the neighbor to the hospital, she said. Taranto was looking for a shelter for the neighbor’s two dogs. By the time Taranto left the area, the highway into Flagstaff was shut down and she had to drive an extra two hours back home. At least two other neighbors didn’t evacuate, she said. “To see flames several yards away from your property line and to hear the propane tanks bursting in the background, it was very surreal,” Taranto said. “Ash falling down. It was crazy.” The wind is expected to be a challenge the rest of the week, along with warmer-than-average weather and low humidity, the National Weather Service said. “I don’t see any significant decreases in wind, I don’t see any big bump ups in humidity and, at this point, we’re not really expecting any precipitation either,” said meteorologist Robert Rickey. Red flag warnings blanketed much of Arizona and New Mexico on Tuesday, indicating conditions are ripe for wildfires. Residents in northern New Mexico’s Mora and San Miguel counties were warned to be ready to evacuate as wildfires burned there amid dry, warm and windy conditions. The National Interagency Fire Center reported Tuesday that nearly 2,000 wildland firefighters and support personnel were assigned to more than a dozen large wildfires in the Southwestern, Southern and Rocky Mountain areas. Scientists say climate change has made the U.S. West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive. Elsewhere in Arizona, firefighters battled a wildfire in a sparsely populated area of the Prescott National Forest, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of Prescott.  Cory Carlson, the incident commander with the Prescott National Forest, said late Tuesday afternoon the high winds have been the biggest challenge, sending embers into the air that sparked new spot fires near State Route 261, along with the demand for crews at other fires.  “We do have a lack of resources,\" he said. “There’s a lot of fires in the region.” Some areas were evacuated, and a shelter was set up at Yavapai College. Carlson appealed to residents to abide by evacuation orders. The cause of the 600-acre (2.4 square-kilometer) wildfire was under investigation.  In southern Arizona, a principal highway route between Bisbee and Sierra Vista reopened Tuesday after being closed for about eight hours due to a brush fire in the hills overlooking Bisbee. ___ Associated Press writer Paul Davenport in Phoenix, Susan Montoya Bryan in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Scott Sonner in Reno, Nevada, contributed to this report.

(628, '/tech/solar-power-cell-perovskite-b2062365.html', 6, 'independent', '‘Miracle material’ breakthrough could revolutionise solar power', 'Scientists have discovered a way to make ultra-efficient solar cells on a commercial scale using the “miracle material” perovskite. A team from the City University of Hong Kong (CityU) and Imperial College London made the discovery in a breakthrough that could have major implications for renewable energy production and reaching zero carbon objectives. Perovskite has been hailed for its remarkable properties compared to tradtional silicon solar cells, however until now they have been too unstable to be suitable for commercial use.  The next-generation cells are expected to cost less, have a much higher power conversion efficiency, and be lightweight and flexible – opening up new applications like coating glass windows with thin layers of transparent solar panels.  Zeev Valy Vardeny, a Distinguished Professor of Physics at the University of Utah, described perovskite’s unique properties in 2017 as “unbelievable, a miracle material”. At the time, commercialisation of the technology was thought to be at least a decade away, however this discovery could push that forward considerably. The chemists were able to overcome perovskite’s difficult properties by making use of a metal-containing material called ferrocenes, which they added as an interface betewen the light-absorbing layer of the solar cell and the layer that transports electrons. “The unique properties of ferrocenes can help overcome the problems with perovskite solar cells,” said Professor Nicholas Long from Imperial College’s Department of Chemistry. Using this breakthrough technique, the scientists became the first team to create a solar cell capable of performing at a similar level to silicon cells while still remaining stable. Tests of the new solar cells found that they could run under continuous illumination for more than 1,500 hours while retaining 98 per cent of their initial efficiency. “The most important part of this work is that we successfully fabricated highly efficient perovskite solar cells while providing promising stability,” said Dr Zhu Zonglong, an assistant professor in CityU’s Department of Chemistry. “The reliable results mean that the commercialisation of perovskites is on its way. We aim to scale up the production of perovskite solar cells using this novel molecule and facile method, contributing to the global ‘zero-carbon’ sustainability goal.” The researchers have patented the design, which was described in a paper published in the journal Science on Thursday.

O2, EE, Vodafone and Three ranked lower on customer service and value for money than lesser-known rivals, according to a survey of phone users. This is despite virtual networks using the same phone masts and other infrastructure as the so-called Big Four rather than running their own services. Three scored the lowest of the Big Four and received the lowest rating out of any network for reliability. Nearly half (45%) of Three users experienced problems in the past year compared to three in ten (29%) across all mobile network customers surveyed. Virtual network Smarty uses the same infrastructure as Three but came first place in the table with five out of five stars for value for money. The largest UK network, EE, came 11th out of the 16 providers analysed with users reporting mediocre customer service, technical support and value for money. The network’s download speeds were the only category to gain a four star rating. The Big Four providers currently service three quarters (76%) of customers in the UK, according to Ofcom. But consumer champions Which? say the flexibility offered by virtual networks keeps mobile costs down and could better support consumers facing a household budget squeeze. Anyone looking for a reliable carrier that offers a flexible contract and good value for money should consider one of the virtual networks, who continue to outperform the Big Four year after year It found customers pay on average almost £10 a month less than Big Four customers across all contract types. Natalie Hitchins at Which? Said: “The vast majority of mobile users are with one of the Big Four providers, but our research suggests consumers could save money during the cost-of-living crisis and get better service by switching to one of the networks challenging their dominance. “Anyone looking for a reliable carrier that offers a flexible contract and good value for money should consider one of the virtual networks, who continue to outperform the Big Four year after year.” Which? said customers of the Big Four experienced price hikes of up to 11% but remained the most loyal, with more than half of EE, O2 and Vodafone users being with the provider for more than five years. Experts warn these longer-staying customers are likely to be paying more than they need to for their phone contract. Which? suggests challenger providers have an edge over bigger players by focusing on rolling monthly sim deals over phones with lengthy contracts. Retail sales dropped in March as the rising cost of living hit households and shoppers cut back on unnecessary purchases, the ONS reported on Friday. And steaming giant Netflix reported a sharp drop in subscribers in a sign consumers are cutting back on subscription services to save money. An EE spokesperson said: “EE customers enjoy being part of the UK’s biggest and fastest network with more 5G coverage than any other provider and EE has been named the UK’s best network for the past eight years by RootMetrics. “We provide the best customer service across the industry reflected in the most recent Ofcom complaints data”.

The most recent solar flare erupted from the Sun’s surface Wednesday evening, according to Nasa, and the space agency’s Solar Dynamics Observatory caught an image of the flare as it erupted. A solar flare is an explosion and concomitant eruption of radiation from the surface of the Sun. Some solar flares also trigger a coronal mass ejection, a plume of charged particles flung free of the Sun and which can interrupt communications and damage electric grids or satellites when reaching Earth. Wednesday’s flare follows on the heels of two solar flares observed on the evening of Tuesday 19 April. The first of Tuesday’s flares was a relatively mild, M-class flare, as was the flare on Wednesday. But the second flare on Tuesday was the most powerful solar flare observed in five years, an X-class flare. An M-class flare is a tenth the size of an X-class flare, where additional numbers denote a flare’s specific strength. The X-class flare on Wednesday measured an X2.2 using the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scale, a strong but not severe flare. The most powerful flare ever recorded was seen in 2003 and measured greater than X28. The increasing frequency and intensity of solar eruptions are to be expected as the Sun heads toward the peak of its 11-year sunspot cycle sometime in 2025. The magnetic field lines that form sunspots are also involved in solar eruptions, flares, and coronal mass ejections. The increasing solar activity comes at the same time as an unprecedented amount of space activity, especially new commercial satellites in low Earth orbit, all of which can be threatened by solar eruptions. On 4 February, a geomagnetic storm caused by a coronal mass ejection swelled Earth’s upper atmosphere and dragged 40 newly launched SpaceX satellites out of orbit.

The subscription platform – best known for allowing users to pay for access to adult and sexual content, though used by other creators too – said that it was having problems processing payments on behalf of those accounts. Until now, UK-based OnlyFans has been one of only a few notable Western tech companies that have continued operating in Russia after the invasion of Ukraine. And the latest restrictions appear to be driven by technical issues rather than a policy decision to leave the country. “OnlyFans is a creator first business,” the company said in a statement to Motherboard, which first reported the news. “Over the past few months we have explored several options to continue providing our services to creators impacted by the Russia / Ukraine war. “However, due to a further tightening of payment restrictions to and from Russia, OnlyFans can no longer properly serve our Russian creator community. As a result, we are taking steps to temporarily pause accounts where payments are received in Russia.” Many western technology companies pulled out of Russia in response to pressure from users and even the Ukrainian government. That has meant that its online creators are unable to make money from popular platforms such as Instagram or YouTube. Many western payment operators, such as American Express and Mastercard, have stopped operations in Russia in the wake of the war, and Russia has been partly banned from the SWIFT framework that underpins many financial transactions. That has made even sending payments to people within the country difficult. OnlyFans’ policy decisions have been driven by payment providers in the past. Last summer, it announced that it would be banning adult content – seemingly in response to pressure from payment companies – before reversing the decision soon after.

An annular meteor shower observed since antiquity, the Lyrids are known for producing as many as 10 to 20 shooting stars at their peak, which is estimated to be 22 April this year, though at least some Lyrids will be seen through 30 April. The Lyrids will appear to radiate from a point, known as the “radiant,” in the Northeastern sky near the constellation Lyra, with viewing best between midnight and dawn local time. The website timeanddate.com offers a tool showing how and when to find the radiant in the night sky. However, a waxing gibbous Moon rising near midnight in many locales could impede viewing for some hoping to catch the show, and those intent on catching shooting stars may wish to consult the International Dark-Sky Association’s tool for finding sites with little light pollution. A dark sky site won’t help with moonlight, but will at least reduce human-made glare. And for those that can’t make it to a dark sky site, can’t stay up so late, or face other obstacles, such as foul weather, the International Dark-Sky Association is also offering a live stream of the Lyrid meteor shower as seen from a location in China on the association’s Youtube channel. The Lyrids result from Earth passing through the trail of dust left by the comet Comet C/1861 G1 Thatcher, which was discovered back in 1861 during its most recent close approach to the Sun. Comet C/1861 G1 Thatcher takes around 415 years to make one orbit. But humans have been watching the shooting stars caused by the comet for much longer, with records of the Lyrid meteor shower dating back 2,700 years, according to Nasa. If you can’t watch the Lyrids in person or online, you may get another chance during other upcoming meteor showers. In the Southern hemisphere, particularly around the tropics, the eta Aquariids meteor shower will peak around 4 or 5 May. The alpha Capricornids shower, meanwhile, will be visible to both north and south, with a peak of 30 to 31 July.

The smart speaker company will position the new soundbar as its entry-level model, at a price far cheaper than any of its existing sounders, the report claims. It suggests that Sonos is no longer looking to allow other companies to make more accessible sounders and stay at the top of the market. Instead, it is likely to position the new speaker as an easy way into its system of internet-enabled speakers. The soundbar is currently nicknamed Fury, scheduled in for a release date on 7 June, will cost around $249 or probably the same price in pounds, and will come in black or white, according to a new report from The Verge. The company accurately leaked Sonos’s recent Roam portable speaker before its release. Its low price means that it will come without some of the features that have arrived with other recent Sonos speakers. There will be no microphones for voice control, for instance, and no Dolby Atmos for the kind of detailed surround sound that first arrived with Sonos’s much more expensive Arc speaker. It will more closely compete with the Sonos Beam, which currently sells for around $449 or the same price in pounds. But in line with its price, it will be smaller and less capable than that current entry-level offering. The ‘Fury’ soundbar could also function as a rear speaker for Dolby Atmos setups when paired with that Arc, The Verge suggested. It would be turned up on its side and mounted vertically for extra definition when compared with other Sonos speakers used as surrounds, such as the One. The company is still working on a smaller and cheaper subwoofer as well as its widely rumoured headphones, The Verge also reported.

That access is achieved through accessibility technology that is intended to make the phone able to adapt to those users with different needs. But it can also be used to access the sound from phone calls and store them. Google’s documentation makes clear that it is not intended for recording phone calls and that new changes will stop apps from being able to do so. Those changes go into effect on 11 May and mean that no apps will be able to record calls. It is not clear whether developers will comply with the ruling or if Google will be forced to remove apps that do not comply from the online store. But it is specifically limited to the Google Play Store, meaning that phones that come with call-recording apps that are built in will still be able to do so. Those system apps do not need permission to access phone calls since they are built into the phone. Google has been progressively making it more difficult to record phone calls on Android, by removing the ways they can access the audio from the phone. It does so in the name of privacy and security, and to ensure that users do not break laws against call recording that exist in some states and countries. The decision also brings it in line with the iPhone, which already makes it impossible for apps to record phone calls and offers no built-in apps with that functionality.

The latest dramatic eruption came amid an increasing amount of activity on our Sun, and warnings that it could lead to potentially dangerous solar weather. The Sun appears to be moving into a particularly active period of its 11-year cycle of activity. That began in 2019, and is expected to peak in 2025. Solar flares are powerful bursts of energy that come out of our star and can direct dangerous blasts towards the Earth. This week’s record-breaking flare – the strongest in this solar cycle – did not do significant damage to Earth. But scientists have warned that the Sun is moving into a more active period in its solar cycle, which could bring yet more energetic flares, some of which could point towards our planet. Solar weather can cause damage to electrical grids, knock out satellites, harm astronauts and space equipment, and more. Scientists have routinely warned that the world is not prepared for the danger posed by more significant solar activity, especially given the vast amount of new satellites above Earth since the Sun’s most recent peak. Nasa said it had actually spotted two solar flares on the evening of 19 April. The first was relatively moderate, but it was then followed by another strong one later in the evening. There were some effects on Earth. There was a brief radio blackout for some communications in Asia. But for the most part our planet avoided the full blast of the storm because it came out of the far edge of the Sun, and so missed Earth. The second was an X-class flare, the most intense possible flare. It was the most intense to be spotted since 2017. As well as marking flares with a letter, scientists also give them a number: the latest was classified as X2.2. Higher numbers mean more intense flares – and the strongest ever seen was in 2003, which reached more than X28.

Speaking at an event co-hosted by Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and the Obama Foundation on Thursday, Mr Obama said the world was at “another tumultuous, dangerous moment in history”. The former US president pointed fingers at the Kremlin, accusing Russia of using US-based social media platforms to spread misinformation in the lead up to the country’s 2016 elections. “People like Putin, and Steve Bannon for that matter, understand it’s not necessary for people to believe in order to weaken democratic institutions,” Mr Obama said during his hour-long keynote address. “You just have to flood a country’s public square with enough raw sewage. You just have to raise enough questions, spread enough dirt, plant enough conspiracy theorising, that citizens no longer know what to believe,” he said. He accused social media platforms of being designed with all the wrong incentives in place for their users that end up “turbocharging some of humanity’s worst impulses”. The 44th US president said the “very design” of these platforms was tilting users in the “wrong direction”, adding that it may not be too late to make different choices. “Not all problems we are seeing now are an inevitable byproduct of this new technology. They’re also the result of very specific choices made by the companies that have come to dominate the internet, generally, and social media platforms in particular,” he said. “Solving the disinformation problem won’t cure all that ails our democracies or tears at the fabric of our world. But it can help rebuild the trust and solidarity needed to make democracy stronger,” Mr Obama tweeted. While he did not delve into specific policy changes that could be a solution to the problems caused by these platforms, Mr Obama said regulatory interventions such as the European Union’s Digital Markets Act are a path forward. He also mentioned the Platform Accountability and Transparency Act — bipartisan legislation that would require social media platforms to open up their data to researchers outside these companies. “I believe we should use every tool at our disposal to secure our greatest gift – a government of, by, and for the people – for generations to come,” he said.

(639, '/tech/nasa-new-material-alloy-space-b2061008.html', 6, 'independent', 'Nasa invents ‘revolutionary’ material to transform space exploration', 'Nasa scientists have invented a new metal alloy that is 1,000 times more durable than current state-of-the-art materials used in aviation and space exploration. The US space agency believes that Alloy GRX-810 could revolutionise space travel, as it can withstand far harsher conditions than existing materials used within rocket engines. The material has twice the strength, three-and-a-half times the flexibility and more than 1,000 times the durability under stress at high temperatures. “This breakthrough is revolutionary for materials development,” said Dale Hopkins, deputy project manager of Nasa’s Transformational Tools and Technologies project “New types of stronger and more lightweight materials play a key role as Nasa aims to change the future of flight. Previously, an increase in tensile strength usually lowered a material’s ability to stretch and bend before breaking, which is why our new alloy is remarkable.” The new alloy’s composition was determined using computational models, before 3D printing technology allowed Nasa engineers to create a turbine engine combustor – a vital component found in rocket engines that serves as a fuel-air mixer. “Applying these two processes has drastically accelerated the rate of our materials development. We can now produce new materials faster and with better performance than before,” said Tim Smith, a material research scientist at Nasa’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland and one of the inventors of this new alloy. “What used to take years through a trial-and-error process, now takes a matter of weeks or months to make discoveries.” The manufacturing process is also more efficient, cost effective and cleaner than conventional methods. Nasa said the alloy would result in “vast performance improvements” and would have “major implications for the future of sustainable flight”. In a press release detailing the discovery, the space agency said: “Designers can now contemplate tradeoffs they couldn’t consider before, without sacrificing performance.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

SpaceX Falcon 9 carries Axiom-1 — Friday April 8 Axiom-1, the first all-private mission to the ISS, is scheduled to launch from Nasa’s Kennedy Space Center at 11.17am. ET on Friday. A four-person crew from Axiom Space will lift off in a SpaceX Crew Dragon Capsule atop a Falcon 9 rocket to spend eight days on the space station conducting experiments on robotics, cancer biology and laundry detergent.  Liver coverage of the launch can be found on both the SpaceX website and the Axiom Space website beginning around 7.55am ET, while Nasa will livestream the launch activities beginning around 10am ET.  Axiom Space is a commercial space station company developing a new module for the International Space Station, a module the company hopes to add on to and eventually detach to become a stand alone, private space station by the time the ISS is retired in 2030. While Axiom is developing its space station, it plans to send regular flights of commercial space crews to the ISS to aid in the module development and to participate in space tourism. Axiom-1 will be the first such mission. The crew of Axiom-1 includes former Nasa astronaut Michael López-Alegría as mission commander, Canadian investment banker Mark Pathy as a mission specialist, Larry Connor, an education nonprofit executive from Ohio as the mission pilot, while Israeli Air Force veteran and businessman Eytan Stibbe also serve as a mission specialist. The four crew will spend eight days aboard the ISS before returning to Earth. While a SpaceX dragon capsule will take the Axiom-2 crew to the ISS, its competitor will get a second shot at an uncrewed flight to the space station sometime in the next month and a half. Nasa’s SLS and Orion – TBD On Monday 4 April, Nasa will began the “wet dress rehearsal” of its Space Launch System (SLS) Moon rocket and the Orion spacecraft at its apex. The testing involves pumping cryogenic fuel into the rocket, testing countdown, and other systems, and then recovering the fuel and liquid oxygen from the launch vehicle, which is why it’s called a “wet” dress rehearsal for launch. But Nasa called a halt to the test late Monday morning after pumping half of the expect liquid oxygen into the big rocket when a pressure control valve triggered a safety warning.  Nasa officials said the valve issue is the type of minor problem the wet dress rehearsal is designed to detect, and did not reflect any major problem with the rocket. They plan to try again to complete the wet dress rehearsal sometime after the Axiom-1 launch on Friday.  The SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft together make up the core of Nasa’s Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the Moon with the Artemis III mission planned for 2025. The space agency rolled the 322-foot-tall rocket out of the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center on 17 March to complete final testing on launchpad 39B before a test flight, the uncrewed Artemis I mission, later this year.  After the wet dress rehearsal, Nasa will roll the SLS back into the Vehicle Assembly Building for final assessments and determination of the Artemis I launch data — the space agency is currently considering launch windows in May, June, and July. If Artemis I can blast off this year, Artemis II, a crewed mission to orbit the Moon, is scheduled for May 2024. Mars Helicopter’s 25th flight — Sometime after April 8 Although Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory can’t yet say exactly when, its Ingenuity helicopter is gearing up for a record breaking flight on Mars sometime after Friday.  When it does lift off, the twin-rotor, battery and solar powered drone will make a 704-metre flight above the Martian Jezero Crater to scout a path up a dry river bed for the Perseverance Mars rover.  Helicopter and rover arrived on Mars together in February 2021, with Ingenuity making its first flight on 19 April 2019, the first powered, controlled flight on another world. The Ingenuity team at JPL was recently awarded the prestigious Collier trophy for achievements in aerospace for Ingenuity’s performance. Boeing’s OST-2 – early April Nasa awarded two companies with contracts for its Commercial Crew program to fly astronauts to the ISS, SpaceX and Boeing. But while SpaceX began regular service with Crew Dragon in 2020, Boeing’s Strainer spacecraft ran into a computer glitch during its 2019 orbital test flight that prevented the uncrewed spacecraft from docking with the space station. A second shot at that test flight, a mission enumerated as OST-2, was further delayed in August and was rescheduled for 20 May. According to reporting by Spaceflight Now, however, a change in the launch schedule of a Space Force payload could allow OST-2 to launch aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket in the first half of April. Nasa Crew-4 — 21 or 23 April Nasa’s fourth mission to the ISS as part of the space agency’s Commercial Crew program will now lift of at least a day later than previously scheduled to accommodate the Axiom-1 launch on Friday, the head of Nasa’s human spaceflight program Kathy Lueders posted on Twitter Wednesday.  Nasa’s Commercial Crew Missions have flown aboard SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets in SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft since 2020. The Crew-4 mission, unlike Axiom-1, consists of only government astronauts — Nasa astronauts Jessica Watkins, Kjell Lindgren, Bob Hines, and European Space Agency astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti.

(642, '/tech/iphone-apple-cable-wire-b2062691.html', 6, 'independent', 'The iPhone could be about to get a new charging cable', 'Apple could be forced to change the plug on the bottom of the iPhone, after a new EU vote. MEPs overwhelmingly supported new rules that would require all devices to be equipped with USB-C ports, whoever they are made by. That would apply to mobile phones, tablets, camera, headphones and other gadgets that are charged up through a wired cable. The most prominent company likely to be affected by the change is Apple, whose iPhones have used the Lightning charging cable for the last 10 years. Apple does use USB-C on other devices, such as its iPads, but has been resolute about the advantages of the smaller Lightning cable for its phones and accessories such as the AirPods. The EU said that the decision to force companies to include the same charger comes as “part of a broader EU effort to address product sustainability, in particular of electronics on the EU market, and to reduce electronic waste”. It would also ensure that customers would not get confused about what charger they need, it said. And it would avoid people ending up with more chargers than they need. The new rules also address wireless charging. MEPs called on the European Commission to formulate a strategy by the end of 2026 that would allow charging solutions to work together. Apple has been rumoured to be planning an iPhone that would come without any ports at all, instead charging up through wireless capabilities similar to those already in the device. But it has never publicly committed to such a device, and there is no indication of when it might arrive. Apple has long argued that any change to charges should instead focus on the other end of the charging cable, where it plugs into the wall. If that was standardised, then phone companies could use whatever plug they want but customers would still be able to find a way to plug them in, it has said. In 2020, Apple said the plan would “stifle innovation”, harm customers, and in fact create far more electronic waste as iPhone users would be forced to adopt a whole new charging port. The latest approval by MEPs means that the new rules will go to the European Parliament as a a whole for approval, which is expected to happen in May. Once that is complete, MEPs will start working with EU governments to agree the final legislation.

(643, '/tech/playstation-xbox-ads-games-free-b2062668.html', 6, 'independent', 'PlayStation and Xbox are adding ads to games, rumours say', 'Both PlayStation and Xbox are working on ads within games, according to new rumours. The development would allow the companies to make games available for free, with the cost being supported through marketing, reports suggest. PlayStation would put real-life ads on virtual billboards within games, for instance, according to a new report from Advertising Insider. Players could also be rewarded for engaging with ads by being given free virtual items. Xbox was last week said to be working on a similar programme, with the same aim of giving out free games. Both companies are said to be launching the products by the end of the year. The development would allow console games to function more like mobile games, where free-to-play and ad-supported games are rife. But it would also likely to lead to the same questions that have dogged those games, such as concerns about the nature of ads, potential scams, and the kind of the tracking of players that advertisers are allowed to do. Such tracking has caused fallouts between advertising companies and tech platforms before. When Apple added new privacy protections in a recent iOS update, for instance, it was attacked by Facebook, which said it was punishing advertisers by stopping them gathering data on users. Some console games have already experimented with actual advertising. EA added marketing videos into UFC 4, before being forced to remove them because of criticism from fans, and NBA 2K21 has ads in its loading screens. Microsoft is said not to be planning to take any of the revenue from the advertising, with the funds being split between developers and ad companies. Sony is yet to decide how the revenue will be split, the new report claims.

The billionaire has commitments from Morgan Stanley and other financial institutions that can fund the bid for the company, he said in documents published by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr Musk is yet to decide whether he will make a tender offer to buy the whole of the company or if he might make other steps to try and take over the company, he said. A tender offer would see the billionaire buy some or all of the shares in a company from its current stockholders. The announcement is the latest event in ongoing and public discussions between Mr Musk and Twitter. The events began when he announced that he had bought more than 9 per cent of Twitter, making him the biggest company’s biggest shareholder. He was initially offered and took up a seat on the board, which would have come with restrictions on how much he could own, before he reversed course and decided against joining Twitter’s leadership. Instead, he publicly announced that he wanted to take Twitter private by buying the company at $54.20 per share, valuing it at about $43 billion. On Friday, Twitter said that it was adopting a so-called “poison pill”, which is intended to stop a hostile takeover of the company. Mr Musk’s latest filing suggests he is still considering a purchase of Twitter despite its management’s actions. It leaves open the option to discuss a takeover with members of Twitter’s board and others. But it also indicates that he could sell all of his existing shares in the company, too.

The four member crew of Axiom-1, all private citizens flying aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft chartered by commercial space station company Axiom Space, reached the ISS on 9 April and were supposed to splash down in waters off the Florida coast Tuesday. But potentially hazardous weather forced Nasa to reschedule the splashdown to Sunday afternoon.  Crew-4, Nasa’s fourth mission of government astronauts to ride a Crew Dragon to the ISS, meanwhile, was supposed to launch as early as Saturday morning. But since the ISS only has two docking ports where a Crew Dragon and mate with the station, and both ports are currently occupied by the two spacecraft that ferried Nasa’s Crew-3 mission and the Axiom-1 mission to the ISS, someone has got to come home before the waiting astronauts can go up.  The earliest Crew-4 could launch is now 4.15 a.m. Eastern on Tuesday 26 April, although Nasa is also eyeing launch windows on the 27 and 28 April as well.  The four crew of Axiom-1 — former Nasa astronaut and mission commander Michael López-Alegría along with the three Axiom customers who paid $55 million each to fly on the mission, Mark Pathy, Larry Connor, and Eytan Stibbe — arrived on the ISS on 9 April for what was supposed to be an eight-day mission. The crew conducted various science experiments during their stay, although Axiom hopes later private mission astronauts will help the company build out the commercial modules it plans to add to the ISS, the basis of what may one day become a free flying commercial space station.  Nasa’s Crew-4 team, mission commander Kjell Lindgren, mission pilot Bob Hines, and mission specialist Jessica Watkins, and European Space Agency astronaut, mission specialist Samantha Cristoforetti, plan to stay on the ISS for about six months, returning to Earth sometime in the fall of 2022.  Nasa will stream the departure activities for Axiom-1 beginning around 6.15 p.m. Eastern time on Saturday 23 April on the space agency’s website. Nasa coverage of the Crew-4 launch will also stream on the Nasa website at a time to be determined after Nasa sets the launch time for the mission.

(646, '/space/mars-rover-phobos-eclipse-b2061976.html', 6, 'independent', 'Nasa’s Mars rover captured a partial eclipse of the Sun', 'When Phobos, the lumpy, potato-shaped Martian moon passed in front of the Sun as seen from the Red Planet on 2 April, Nasa’s Perseverance rover was there to witness the resulting eclipse.  In a video posted to Nasa’s Youtube channel and on the Nasa Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) website, the dark shape of Phobos can be seen passing in front of the orange disk of the Sun in just under a minute.  At more than six miles in diameter, Phobos neither completely blocks out the Sun like a total eclipse seen from Earth, nor takes very long to transit the Sun’s face.  Capturing Solar eclipses by the two Martian moons Phobos and Deimos is nothing new – Nasa rovers Spirit and Opportunity both took time lapse photos of Phobos passing in front of the Sun back in 2004.  But the new video and images taken by Perseverance capture a Martian solar eclipse with unprecedented focus and resolution thanks to new camera technology on what is Nasa’s newest Mars rover.  The 2 April eclipse was imaged using the twin Mastcam-Z cameras mounted on Perseverance’s 2-metre-tall mast. The Mastcam-Z cameras have allowed the rover to zoom in on distant objects and take high quality, 3D images and video of the Martian surface. Combined with a special solar filter, the cameras have now provided scientists with incredible details of a solar eclipse on Mars.  “You can see details in the shape of Phobos’ shadow, like ridges and bumps on the moon’s landscape,” Mark Lemmon, a planetary astronomer with the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado, who helped arrange the Phobos observations, said in a statement. “You can also see sunspots. And it’s cool that you can see this eclipse exactly as the rover saw it from Mars.” Perseverance landed on Mars in February 2021, and has spent the past year and change exploring the Jezero Crater along with Ingenuity, Nasa’s award winning Mars helicopter.  Perseverance has also cached Martian soil samples that Nasa hopes to return to earth for further study in the late 2020s and early 2030s.  In the meantime, Perseverance will continue sending back images of the Red Planet that delight even the scientists and engineers that built and operate the robot.  “I knew it was going to be good,” Rachel Howson, one of the Mastcam-Z team camera operators said of the Perseverance images’ quality in a statement, “but I didn’t expect it to be this amazing.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(647, '/tech/elon-musk-tesla-robot-optimus-b2062330.html', 6, 'independent', 'Musk says Tesla’s robot will be worth more than company’s car business', 'Tesla chief Elon Musk has said the company’s humanoid robot Optimus would eventually be “worth more than” its self-driving car business. Full self-driving (FSD) is a set of Tesla’s advanced driver-assistance system features which uses the electric vehivle’s onboard cameras and artificial intelligence (AI) technology to perform some driving tasks such as automatic lane changes and semi-autonomous navigation. During the company’s first-quarter 2022 earnings call on Wednesday, Mr Musk said the company is continuing to work on its humanoid robot Optimus, first unveiled last year in August. Built using the same AI that the electric car company uses for its vehicles, the billionaire had said the robot will be approximately 173cm tall (5ft 8in), weigh around 57kg (126lb), and be built from “lightweight materials”. With a display screen somewhere on its body to show information, the Tesla chief said the robot is “intended to be friendly and navigate through a world built for humans” at a “mechanical level”. “Essentially, in the future, physical work will be a choice. If you want to do it, you can, but you won’t need to do it”, Mr Musk had said. On Wednesday’s earnings call, he expressed the “firm belief” that the robot would bring more business to the company in future than its cars. “I was surprised people did not realise the magnitude and importance of this programme. Those who are insightful or listen carefully will understand that Optimus will ultimately be worth more than the car business, worth more than FSD,” he said. In January, the world’s richest man had described the robot as the most important product Tesla is developing in 2022, “more significant” than the company’s car business. He had said that Optimus is built to serve as a general-purpose robot, though early versions will have limited factory-based applications. “It has profound implications for the economy, given that the economy at its foundational level is labour,” Mr Musk had said. It remains to be seen if a working prototype of the humanoid bot would be unveiled at some point this year as the billionaire had said.

(648, '/arts-entertainment/tv/features/ella-purnell-yellowjackets-interview-army-of-the-dead-b2063842.html', 9, 'independent', 'Ella Purnell: ‘I got so much s*** after Army of the Dead’', 'The first thing you notice about Ella Purnell is her accent. It’s British. Very British. The actor possesses the sort of born-in-Whitechapel, raised-in-Bethnal Green accent that four years of LA living has done nothing to dim. It’s a testament to her acting skills, which are typically put to use in Stateside roles. “Actor does accent” is not news, obviously – but when someone makes their mark playing a ponytail-flipping, soccer-playing, all-American teen as Purnell did in last year’s runaway hit Yellowjackets, “bloke” is the last word you expect to hear from her mouth. “I did say ‘obvs’ the other day, though,” she cringes. “I’m a monster.” Monster is harsh, but it’s certainly in the vicinity of vocabulary that fans used to describe Purnell’s character in Yellowjackets, a queen bee with a mean streak, who becomes stranded in the wilderness with her football team after a plane crash. The series toggles between the aftermath of the accident and its present-day survivors, played by adult actors. “Unlikeable,” is how Purnell describes the parts she gravitates to. “It fills me with rage to think of playing ‘the girlfriend’ or the ‘damsel in distress’. Blah blah blah.” She rolls her eyes, which for Purnell, is a grander gesture than it sounds. Finding your signature as an actor can be difficult, but Purnell was born with hers: a set of enormous green eyes. Everything else – her slight five-foot-three frame, button nose, and cropped bob – shrinks in comparison. Directors love to film her eyes. In the promotional poster for Yellowjackets, they’re tearful; the shadow of a demon-like creature is reflected in the pupil. Across Netflix’s zombie heist movie Army of the Dead, they were fixated in equal parts terror and determination. To watch Purnell as a pixie waif in 2016’s Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children is to witness Tim Burton’s imagination come to life: wide-eyed, wasp-waisted, and spindly-legged. Her next role does away with those eyes altogether, if only because it is a voice-over part. More specifically, Purnell is lending her voice, minus the east-London accent, to the alien life form Gwyndala in Nickelodeon’s highly anticipated series Star Trek: Prodigy. Purnell hasn’t seen Star Trek. “Honestly, the shame that I feel around that has really taken hold,” she laughs, vowing to binge the entire thing over the weekend. In terms of voice acting, Star Trek isn’t her first rodeo. Last year, she starred opposite Hailee Steinfeld as the voice of Jinx in Netflix’s Arcane, a quietly – but hugely – successful series based on the computer game League of Legends. Despite little fanfare, the show has a coveted 100 per cent rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Purnell won an Annie award for her work on the series. “I literally could not believe it. I was like, ‘I am a scam artist…’” she says, only half joking. If there is a thread connecting Purnell’s characters – besides their large eyes, animated or otherwise – it is the fact they are mostly headstrong, opinionated women. Moments after meeting the actor, who is abuzz on foamy lattes and kicked back on the couch, it becomes clear that such roles aren’t far from the real thing. But the problem with playing the “badass chick” in action fare is how closely “badass” is associated with scantily clad. ​​Apparently, the best attire for slaughtering enemies and fleeing danger is a bra, hot pants, and platform boots. “It’s still very new to see a woman be violent in a way that isn’t fetishised or used for the gore tactic. In Yellowjackets, we’re not these half-naked sexy cannibals. We’re just surviving, and you don’t see that often, so it’s interesting when you do.” Fresh off her Annie award for ‘Arcane’, Purnell lends her voice to Gwyn (second to the left) in Nickelodeon’s ‘Star Trek: Prodigy’  This was playing on Purnell’s mind when she signed onto Arcane, but as she puts it, “I wasn’t sure how to ask a room full of blokes: ‘Are we still doing the boobs?’” She had a similar concern over Army of the Dead. “You know, it’s a Netflix Original. Zach Snyder. It all felt very boys’ club,” she recalls. “Being in your early twenties, that s*** comes up all the f***ing time and you have to be really firm about it from the start. So I came in hot, saying, ‘I’m not gonna wear high heels! I’m not gonna wear a push-up bra!’” Only then did she see her costume rail; it was full of cargo pants and tops that one would actually wear to a zombie killing spree. Not a push-up bra in sight. Purnell was relieved but notes “it would’ve been a different conversation 10 years ago”. She quips, “You’re a woman, you get it!” The actor herself is only just starting to “get it”. Putting up boundaries hasn’t always been easy. “I’ve gone into photo shoots when I was 15 and they’ve pulled out a bra and a pair of knickers for me to wear,” she says. “As a 15-year-old, I don’t have the power to say no because I’m thinking, Am I going to get cancelled? Am I not going to work again? Am I going to burn bridges? So, it really becomes the job of other people to protect you.” Purnell counts herself lucky she had the right people around her. “But you can understand how easily it can go the other way for anybody that doesn’t have that support system. There are not enough child protection laws around that.” It’s only as she has gotten older – and more successful – that Purnell has learnt to say no. The irony isn’t lost on her that she needs this skill now less than ever before. “The more well-known you are, the less people push you,” she says. Purnell as queen bee Jackie in last year’s hit thriller series ‘Yellowjackets’  But Purnell isn’t naive. Even now, with a Zach Snyder tent pole, viral hit series, and a Star Trek credit to her name, the actor knows she still must play the game. “How do I put this diplomatically…” she pauses for a second before forging on. “As a woman in this industry, you are constantly trying to find the right balance. You can’t be too strong, you can’t swear, you can’t wear short skirts. You can’t be too sexy because they won’t respect you, but you can’t not be beautiful because then they think you don’t have value. We’re taught to hold our grudges inside because at the end of the day it’s still a man’s world and you’re trying to get paid.’” It’s a matter-of-fact attitude that likely derives from her decades-long experience in an industry notorious for chewing young girls up and spitting them out. Purnell began her career in baby modelling. “I did a Dior campaign – when I was four!” she peals. There was also a memorable commercial for the chocolate caramel brand Toffifee when she was nine. Then came a small part in the West End production of Oliver! “I loved it but realised that I was relatively shy and didn’t have the presence or the confidence to do musical theatre,” she says. Access unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trial The first big job Purnell landed was playing Keira Knightley’s younger counterpart in 2010’s Never Let Me Go. After that, similar roles followed. “It became my thing for a while,” she says. The actor went on to star in Maleficent, embodying the younger version of Angelina Jolie’s character – a role that she bagged over Anya Taylor-Joy (perhaps the only other actor with eyes large enough to rival Purnell’s). Two years later, she played a young Margot Robbie in The Legend of Tarzan. Purnell was conflicted; she didn’t want this to become her schtick but then again, “If someone asks me to be the young Margot Robbie, I’m not gonna say no!” By the time Yellowjackets premiered last year, Purnell had been working for more than a decade. Somehow in that time, she managed to evade the scrutiny that coming of age as a woman in the public eye inevitably brings. Purnell was 21, living in New York alone for the first time, when the tabloids finally got her. “F*** the Daily Mail,” she mutters now. In 2017, it was reported that Purnell was dating Brad Pitt. The Brad Pitt. As in Brad Pitt of Brangelina, that Brad Pitt. Initially, Purnell found the rumours funny. “I sent the story around to my friends being like” – she mimes a hair flip and puts on a haughty voice to intone – “‘Ah yes, me and my boyfriend Braaaad.’ I thought it was hilarious.” The punch line? She had never met him. Pitt was just a producer on Sweetbit​ter, the TV show in which Purnell had been cast. “I went to bed and the next day it was f***ing everywhere. I was terrified and really upset. I felt like I couldn’t leave the house, I was so embarrassed.” Overnight, Purnell became the “brunette British beauty” dating America’s biggest star 35 years her senior. Family members texted to congratulate her on the new relationship. And then Purnell proceeded to do the worst thing she possibly could in that moment: she Googled her name. “I read all the comments saying, ‘She’s a little slut. She’s a gold-digger. She wants to get famous. She’s a homewrecker.’ Not one person was saying, ‘Shame on Brad for dating practically a child.’” Her wide eyes grow wider with incredulity. “Essentially, what the tabloids were implying was that I’d only got the job because I slept with the producer. It never would’ve happened to a 21-year-old male lead of a show,” she says. Now, at a distant-enough emotional remove, Purnell has regrets over how she responded at the time. “A) I should’ve nipped it in the bud sooner. B) I should’ve used that platform to make a political stance.” Purnell as Kate Ward in Zach Synder’s Netflix tent pole ‘Army of the Dead’  Her run-in with fans came a few years later when Army of the Dead was released. “I got more s*** for that movie than I’ve ever got in my whole career,” she groans. On paper, the role seems innocuous. Likeable, even. Purnell plays Kate, the estranged daughter of Dave Bautista’s character, who willingly enters a zombie fight zone – not to win the $200m cash prize but to save her friend. A quick Google search makes it clear that viewers did not take to Kate – to put it nicely. “I can’t explain it,” she says of the backlash. “I got so much s***. It got to the point where I couldn’t post a picture without people commenting, ‘You should kill yourself’, ‘You’re a terrible actress.’” She turned off her comments and put out an Instagram post asking people to “back the f*** off – but in a nice way”. There are no topics off the table with Purnell. No questions that she politely skirts around. For her, the personal is the political. Her Brad Pitt tabloid nightmare? “It reignited my passion for feminism.” The creep-infested industry she has found herself in? “I love talking about it.” The Army of the Dead backlash? Purnell uses her experience to discuss the wider issue of trolls on social media. Purnell appeared plucked from Tim Burton’s imagination as Emma Bloom in the director’s ‘Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children’ Between her candour, her not insignificant charm and that cinematic gaze, it’s easy to see why Purnell has been working steadily since those baby modelling days. It’s less easy to see why she is yet to drop the prefix from the Next Big Thing label she has been assigned all these years. In the days following our conversation, Purnell announces her casting in Amazon’s TV adaptation of the video game Fallout. Surely that will be it; the thing to really make her name. Either way, Purnell doesn’t seem fussed. The upside of working since you were four appears to be patience. Right now, she’s happy sprawled on the couch speaking about anything and everything. When our time is up, she wants to continue. “My cigarette break can wait.” ‘Star Trek: Prodigy’ premieres on 25 April on Nickelodeon UK Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(649, '/arts-entertainment/tv/features/anatomy-of-a-scandal-netflix-rape-victim-b2062265.html', 9, 'independent', 'The big problem with Anatomy of a Scandal’s depiction of rape', 'In the Netflix drama Anatomy of a Scandal, a Tory MP, James Whitehouse (Rupert Friend), confesses to his wife, Sophie (Sienna Miller), that he has been having an affair with a parliamentary aide, and that the story is about to break in the tabloids. Whitehouse, a supercilious ex-public schoolboy with a house in Belgravia, two perfect children and a live-in nanny, believes his indiscretion to be a mere hiccup in his upward political trajectory. A place in the cabinet after the next reshuffle is all but assured, not least because the PM is an old chum from his Oxford days where they were both members of a Bullingdon-esque club called the Libertines. But then the police turn up as Whitehouse is leaving the House of Commons and inform him that the aide in question, Olivia Lytton (Naomi Scott), has made an allegation of rape. In a moment of slow-motion surrealism that has prompted widespread mirth on social media, we watch Whitehouse being lifted into the air and thrown backwards as if he has, literally, been punched in the gut. The trauma, it appears, is all his.  Lately, we have seen a handful of TV dramas tackling the subject of sexual violence and consent. In 2020’s I May Destroy You, writer and actor Michaela Cole offered a nuanced portrait of rape in which the victim, Arabella, pieces together the events of the night before after having her drink spiked. In Netflix’s Unbelievable, a powerful and considered study of “good” vs “bad” victims, we met Kaitlyn Dever’s Marie, who gives a muddled account of her assault at the hands of a serial rapist, leading police officers to pressure her into retracting her statement.  More recently, Four Lives, about the crimes of the real-life serial killer Stephen Port, told the stories of the men Port raped and killed, and the experience of their families as they fought against the complacency of police; while Port, played by Stephen Merchant, appeared on screen, his character and motivations remained deliberately opaque.  Such portrayals are important, reflecting as they do a broader shift in the way society is starting to view sexual assault and trauma. Until recently, male brutality and female passivity were the norm on TV, and rape merely a device to provide tension or titillation. But now we are seeing writers and directors approaching sexual violence with seriousness and sensitivity, focusing less on perpetrators and investigators than the stories of victims and how they are treated in a flawed justice system.  Alas, the makers of Anatomy of a Scandal didn’t get the memo. The series – which is based on a novel by Sarah Vaughan and is produced by David E Kelley, whose credits include Big Little Lies and The Undoing – is less interested in the impact on the victim than the damage to a man’s reputation, and the fallout for his family and party. Lurking on the side-lines is Joshua McGuire’s Malcolm Tucker-ish spin doctor who initially shrugs off the impending scandal: “Sex doesn’t have to kill a career these days,” he tells Whitehouse. “You might even gain some fans among the older male voters.” Later, as the rape allegation comes to light, he changes his mind, urging the prime minister to distance himself from Whitehouse: “If he gets full-on MeToo’d, it will start to make your loyalty look ill-advised,” he cautions.  In fairness, the series does raise some important questions, among them: why does Sophie go to bed with her shoes on? Are Belgravia gardens really that tiny? And why does the House of Commons look absolutely nothing like the House of Commons? Indeed, Anatomy of a Scandal has many problems, from the ham-fisted dialogue and the drunken camera angles to the continued slo-mo sequences in which characters suddenly fall through floors, or are picked up and plonked into a scene that happened 20 years earlier. Meanwhile, the disputed sexual encounter, which takes places in a House of Commons lift, is played and re-played, often in slow motion, and styled like the world’s worst pop video. But it is the absence of the victim’s perspective that rankles most. We learn nothing of Olivia’s character or her life outside of her relationship with Whitehouse, or, indeed, of the impact of the assault and court case. Plot-wise, she remains at the bottom of the pecking order; by the end, we know more about the prosecuting lawyer’s best friend than we do Olivia. And while she does get to give her version of events under cross-examination, her testimony is filtered through the reactions of Sophie who sits in the gallery. Rupert Friend and Sienna Miller in Netflix drama ‘Anatomy of a Scandal’ Ultimately, this is not just the story of political scandal, but a tale of a wronged wife. Sophie, who is played with simmering fury by Miller, has decided to stand by her man despite her suspicion that her husband has been, at best, economical with the truth. At home, she watches him encouraging their children to chant “Whitehouses always come out on top!”, or cheating at Monopoly (he keeps a get out of jail free card in his wallet – subtle, non?), and so begins to reassess their partnership. His life, she realises, has been one of immense privilege, entitlement and of never being told “no”. Of course, not all TV dramas have to provide a teachable moment, and perhaps we shouldn’t take too seriously a series that spells out human emotion by literally punching its characters in the gut. Nonetheless, in a culture where the actions of powerful men are increasingly scrutinised, and the voices of victims more likely to be heard, Olivia’s invisibility feels like a criminal oversight.

(650, '/arts-entertainment/tv/features/selling-sunset-season-5-netflix-b2063085.html', 9, 'independent', 'How Selling Sunset became TV’s most addictive reality show', 'At a lavish event in a Hollywood Hills mansion listed for nearly £33m, estate agents – and stars of Netflix’s Selling Sunset – Chrishell Stause and Christine Quinn are facing off. “So many times you’ve brought toxic energy to me,” Stause tells her co-worker. “Every time I deal with you, you do something insanely, ridiculously hurtful. Like telling all the girls not to like my Instagrams. Like when you had a party and you made fun of me on the drinks list to hundreds of your guests.” It was a custom cocktail consisting of Hendrick’s gin, pineapple juice, tonic and lime, and called “Chrishell’s Two-Faced Tonic”. As the two women lay out their feelings, the pair’s friends and co-workers watch from the sidelines, taking bets on who will get thrown into the swimming pool. That tension-filled moment was an early highlight of Selling Sunset, which enters its fifth season on 22 April. A reality show documenting a fantasy land of extreme wealth, with stiletto-heeled agents selling luxury homes to the world’s richest buyers, the series has since reached a level of success and visibility beyond the cast and crew’s wildest imaginations. “It [became] this watercooler show,” Stause tells me. “People started watching it and then started talking about it. Next thing you know, it felt like everybody was watching it and talking about it.” Selling Sunset creator and executive producer Adam DiVello – who previously produced the OG SoCal reality shows The Hills and Laguna Beach – is similarly grateful for the overwhelmingly positive reception. He gets sent “hundreds” of potential show ideas a week, “and usually it’s never the right cast of people.” Not so with Selling Sunset. “People ask us all the time, ‘Are you scripted?’ And I’m always like, ‘If I did [script the shows], I’d be coming up with much bigger storylines,’” DiVello says. “Thank God we’ve got so lucky with our cast. We find the right people to follow, you know?” From its inception, Netflix’s Selling Sunset has won over audiences with its depictions of ultra-expensive Los Angeles real estate and endlessly juicy inter-office drama. But if you ask DiVello why so many extra viewers tuned into the reality franchise during Covid lockdown, he has one word: “Escapism.” He continues: “I think people just wanted an escape. People love to see the homes. They got to see people going out, doing things, and enjoying life. Nobody was wearing masks at the time [of filming].” Based in West Hollywood, luxury real estate company the Oppenheim Group is run by brothers Jason and Brett Oppenheim and employs agents-turned-influencers Stause, Quinn, Mary Fitzgerald, Davina Potratz, Heather Rae El Moussa (née Young), Maya Vander, and Amanza Smith. The show appears to exist in a world seemingly untouched by sickness and loss. It features cameos from A-list potential buyers, such as Queer Eye’s Karamo Brown, Shang-Chi star Simu Liu, and rapper French Montana. Each episode is a visual wonderland of sprawling mansions, infinity pools, lush landscapes, walk-in closets with more square footage than most peoples’ master bedrooms, and dazzling, spacious kitchens. Even major celebrities are fans. Via social media, Stause learned how “Mindy Kaling watches our show. And Lena Dunham. All these powerhouse women that are off making their own television shows. And all of a sudden you learn that they’re watching your show. It’s pretty exciting.” Born Terrina Chrishell Stause in Draffenville, Kentucky (but not at a Shell gas station, a long running rumour she has since clarified), Stause is both sweet and pragmatic in person. That practical streak is no doubt a result of a hardscrabble upbringing, which she explored in more depth in her recently released memoir, Under Construction: Because Living My Best Life Took a Little Work. Growing up, Stause’s family experienced poverty and homelessness; once she graduated from college, Stause immediately drove to the West Coast, where she worked as a waitress and auditioned for TV and film roles. Prior to Selling Sunset, Stause was best known for playing Amanda Dillon on the soap opera All My Children and Jordan Ridgeway on Days of Our Lives. In 2016, she obtained her real estate licence, and two years later she joined the Oppenheim Group. Though she’s achieved real personal and professional success on Selling Sunset, becoming ultra-close with Fitzgerald and the other women, her foil is undoubtedly Quinn, whom she accused of trying to ruin her life in the season four finale. DiVello felt it was important for the show to feature a well-rounded array of “characters” that viewers could easily relate to. Season one kicked off with the Oppenheim Group hiring Stause, who had recently acquired her real estate licence and could serve as an audience surrogate. “We try to focus on [casting people who] are representative of everybody out there,” DiVello explains. “There needs to be someone big and loud like Christine. Then you have somebody like Mary, who’s more of a moral compass type of person. I think everybody finds somebody that they attach themselves to, or find themselves in. I think we all do that with reality TV shows to some degree.” This is perhaps another indicator of why Selling Sunset has resonated on such a deep level with fans around the world. Netflix does not make its viewer data available, but Parrot Analytics estimates that the show currently ranks at the 83.2th percentile in the reality genre, which means that it has higher demand than 83.2 per cent of all reality titles in the UK. Even though the Oppenheim Group agents seem to have picture-perfect, always-Instagram-ready lives, the show doesn’t shy away from showing heavy duty personal issues and how they deal with them. Access unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trial Arguably one of the series’ most affecting storylines played out in season three, when Stause received a text message from her husband of two years, This Is Us star Justin Hartley, explaining that he would be filing for divorce. With her permission, the cameras followed Stause and captured her shock and emotional arc in real time. In addition to her divorce, she lost both of her parents to lung cancer between 2019 and 2020. Her co-worker Amanza Smith has also spent part of the series attempting to win full custody of her two young children, whom she shares with her ex-husband, former NFL player Ralph Brown. Brown, who stopped paying child support in 2015, went missing in 2019 and has not resurfaced. You’re gonna sink or swim on social media. I feel like I’ve found the right way [to deal] As Selling Sunset moves into its fifth season, it will continue to explore the agents’ careers and relationships. There’s Stause’s romantic relationship with Jason Oppenheim, Mary Fitzgerald’s promotion to office manager, Heather Rae El Moussa’s engagement and wedding, and the entire group’s ongoing fallout with Quinn, who befriends a new agent from Manhattan Beach, Chelsea Lazkani. The series will also follow the romantic arcs of season four’s new additions Emma Hernan and Vanessa Villela. Arguably the most anticipated storyline of the season will be Stause’s relationship with Oppenheim, though the pair parted ways after a few months of dating in December 2021. As she prepares to watch their relationship back, Stause says the entire process – filming and promoting season five – has been “a blessing and a curse”. “In real life, you would have moved on a lot quicker,” she says before taking a more optimistic tone. “That being said, I feel like we’re closer than [ever]. If you have two people that really respect each other and there was a real love there, then in the long term it actually really helps build that foundation for a relationship where there’s nothing that we haven’t talked about.” She adds, “It’s one thing to say you’re friends with your ex when they walk in a restaurant and you’re like, ‘Oh hey, how are you? I hope you’re well.’ This is different. We had to really get in the trenches. I’m proud of that. I’ve never had that with someone after [a breakup] before. I truly do count him as a really close friend.” Chrishell Stause and Jason Oppenheim in ‘Selling Sunset’  For his part, Oppenheim says the split is still too fresh to discuss in depth. But he is equally sincere when he talks about seeing Selling Sunset launch Stause and the other women into new stratospheres of fame and opportunity. “The most rewarding part is watching people I love most succeed,” Oppenheim says. “And in so many different ways: professionally, socially, and financially. As I started feeling more comfortable in my own success, what becomes more rewarding these days is watching those that I love and care about becoming successful and us sharing together in something.” Fitzgerald echoes Oppenheim’s sentiment, but she’s candid about the challenges that come with filming a successful Netflix reality series. “It is a little weird,” she says. “I’ve never had a goal to be in the public eye. So when I go out, if I’m on a red carpet [or] at events, I’m ready for it, and I’m like, ‘this is fun’. But if I’m just sitting at a pub or on vacation at a pool and I see people staring at me, I’m like, ‘Why are they—ahhhh, this is weird!’” The cast is also subject to social media pile-ons, which they engage with to varying degrees. While Oppenheim hardly spends any time on Instagram, Stause says she’s “embraced” the online feedback. “You’re gonna sink or swim,” she acknowledges. “[But] I found this supportive tribe that really encourages transparency. I feel like I’ve found the right way [to deal]. I’m not trying to say I’m invincible to having those days where maybe someone says something that strikes a nerve. But I will say they are very few and far between.” Davina Potratz, El Moussa and Quinn in ‘Selling Sunset’ For DiVello, who has produced multiple reality shows about luxurious cities in warm climates, including the forthcoming Selling Sunset spin-offs Selling Tampa and Selling The OC, the genius of the show ultimately stems from leaning into the concept of Los Angeles as a visual dreamland. “On The Hills I felt as though LA was one of the characters on the show,” he says. “We showcased Los Angeles in a way that it was a fantasy world… I have so many people that come to me and they say, ‘I moved to Los Angeles because of The Hills.’ And so I think with Selling Sunset, I was really excited to do the same thing again. But now it’s [the 2020s]. How can we up the game?” The show has certainly built on that momentum. On 24 April, Netflix will film the show’s first-ever reunion special with Queer Eye’s Tan France set to host. Looking further ahead, DiVello is content to keep Selling Sunset going for as long as Netflix, viewers, and the Oppenheim Group will have him. “I think what’s nice about this show is that it really is about the Oppenheim office,” he says. “As opposed to The Hills, which was really about Lauren [Conrad], right? It’s like Sex and the City and she was the Carrie Bradshaw. But this is a working office. There’s going to be agents that come and go, and people have babies. There’s a lot of questioning [about] who’s staying and who’s going, and [if] people [are] at the point in their lives where they can continue to do this. So as new agents come in, I think hopefully it can go on and on forever and ever.” ‘Selling Sunset’ launches its fifth season on Netflix on Friday 22 April Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(651, '/arts-entertainment/comedy/features/nish-kumar-interview-tour-bbc-mash-report-b2061369.html', 9, 'independent', 'Nish Kumar: ‘My Rishi Sunak joke doesn’t work any more’', 'Nish Kumar has never worried about winding people up. As one of Britain’s most prominent political comedians, the double Edinburgh Comedy Award nominee says what he thinks, whether he’s slagging off Brexit, branding himself “the brown Laurence Fox” or calling Boris Johnson a liar and a racist. In a time when politicians won’t stop banging on about all things “woke” (insert eye roll here), it’s been argued that right-wing comics are the ones sticking their heads above the parapet to receive abuse. One look at Kumar’s Twitter mentions – full of, as he calls it, “real bad stuff” – will show that isn’t the case. Of course, if you’re going to make comedy in times of darkness, it has to be really funny. Luckily, Kumar is one of the country’s best. The Croydon-born performer was raised on political satire, from the great British panel shows like Have I Got News for You and Chris Morris’s dark comedy Brass Eye to British-Asian sketch show Goodness Gracious Me – stuff that, in Kumar’s words, took “serious subject matter and made it into something that was funny and palatable for an audience”. It comes as no surprise then that Kumar would become a satirical comic himself, presenting political programmes such as the topical Radio 4 Extra comedy show Newsjack, The Bugle podcast and the news show Hello America on the short-lived, short-form video platform Quibi. And then there was the BBC Two show The Mash Report which, in being cancelled by the BBC in 2020, became news itself. The show had a decidedly anti-government slant, with Andrew Neil, then a political presenter for the BBC, calling it “self-satisfied, self-adulatory, unchallenged left-wing propaganda” on Twitter. When the network announced that they wouldn’t be bringing Mash back, it was seen as a response to Tory complaints that comedy at the BBC was exclusively left-wing. Kumar’s current live show, Your Power, Your Control, expertly interweaves the political and personal. Topical material will always make up part of a Kumar gig, although he admits that “it’s [an] objectively strange thing to try and make people laugh about the worst subjects possible that you could pick”. In the age of the 24-hour news cycle, he says, you “have to be prepared to rewrite as you go”. “I had a whole bit about Rishi Sunak being the beneficiary of culturally lowered expectations, but now, literally in the last week, that joke doesn’t work any more because everyone f***ing hates him now.” He lets out a big laugh. “That joke literally no longer works.” But Your Power, Your Control isn’t all topical material. The show looks back to 2019, when Kumar was booed off stage at a posh annual lunch for cricket charity the Lord’s Taverners after making anti-Brexit jokes, culminating in someone (poorly) throwing a bread roll at his head. For the first 24 hours PBT (post-bap throw), it was something he laughed at in the pub. But then The Sun ran an article claiming that Kumar had “used his set to promote ‘extreme views’ against Brexit” and it became a national story. The dam was removed, a new wave of “visceral” and “unpleasant” vitriol flooding in. It was, he says, “a crescendo rather than a turning point”. At this stage in his career, you know the kind of thing you’re getting at a Kumar show – when I saw him perform in January, he joked that his audience consisted of Guardian subscribers and people who recently cancelled their Guardian subscription because it “wasn’t left-wing enough”. Still, some anomalies slip through the cracks. When he played in Shrewsbury last month, one bizarre incident happened that caused Kumar to tweet the words: “Why are white people like this part 765545677990876578899.” To sum up a long story, Kumar tried to kick out a rowdy audience member for using his phone, only for the man to tell him that he “thought I had tickets to Romesh [Ranganathan]” anyway. You can see the disbelief in Kumar’s eyes as he tells this story. “I said, ‘That’s not a great joke for you to have made, my white friend’... Apparently he was really apologetic to the staff, but he said, ‘The thing is, just tell him I really did genuinely think I was going to see Romesh.’ I had this moment where I felt bad for accusing him of making a joke. And then I was like, ‘No, that’s even worse!’” Kumar on panel show ‘QI\' Kumar has dealt with casual and not-so-casual racism throughout his whole career. The bread-missile event initially is presented as funny and harmless, but it soon descends into something much darker, with the comic reading out one of the slur-laden death threats he received. “I felt like you need to hear some of the language in order to understand why I had such a reaction to it.” There’s value too, he says, in white audience members “hearing what some of your uncles are saying… just so that people know that we’re not making this s*** up”. Breadgate was one of the first times Kumar became the subject of major national interest, but it certainly wasn’t the last. The comedian hosted The Mash Report (which so riled Andrew Neil) on BBC Two from 2017 to 2020. Mash was originally pitched as a modern-day, British version of US comedy institution The Daily Show – “something completely different that doesn’t really exist on British television”. When reports emerged in 2020 that the new BBC director general Tim Davie was looking to challenge “perceived left-wing comedy bias” at the corporation, The Mash Report’s days felt numbered. In March 2021, the Beeb announced that they’d made the “difficult” decision not to renew it, with the show finding a new home on Dave as Late Night Mash, which Kumar hosted for one season. In the end, he left after the production team refused to let him have a producer role. “I felt to some extent like I was getting blamed for everything anyway, so I may as well have a say,” he tells me. When culture secretary Nadine Dorries announced plans in January to scrap the licence fee in 2027, many left-wing figures claimed that the BBC had spent the last decade trying to appease the Tory government, only to be turned on by them. The corporation was a great idea on paper, they said, but they only had themselves to blame. One might expect Kumar to have been among these voices, yet he was one of the first to defend the BBC, branding the government “a pack of p***ed-up cultural vandals”. “I know that it feels like absolutely everyone hates the BBC right now, and there are good reasons for that, but ending the licence fee is bad news,” he tweeted. I don’t think people who are trying to get rid of the BBC have considered for a second how much stuff they love wouldn’t exist without it Given the treatment of his show, people were slightly surprised he was so quick to defend the BBC, I note. Kumar nods. “Listen, I do think at its core principle, it’s a publicly owned utility and we should where possible, on the political left, be defending publicly owned bodies,” he says. “I understand a lot of people’s frustration with the BBC, I do get that. But I think you need broadcasters that don’t have a remit to make a profit, because [commercially funded] broadcasters aren’t able to take the risks that publicly funded broadcasters can take.” He points to the recently announced plans to privatise Channel 4. “It’s all very well and good for the government to say Channel 4 needs to be like Netflix, but Derry Girls has been a massive hit on Netflix and that was commissioned by f***ing Channel 4.” Public broadcasters, he says, can find emerging talent “who then go on to make s*** tons of money in the commercial sector. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is a classic example of something where this is a buzzy Fringe show that everybody loves, the BBC is able to give her a six-part sitcom, and then Amazon drives a dump truck full of gold up to her house.” ‘As a political comedian, you have to be prepared to rewrite as you go’  He continues: “There is no way a commercial broadcaster would have given Stephen Merchant and Ricky Gervais the commission for a six-part sitcom because neither of them had the profile to do that. There’s absolutely no way The Office would exist without the publicly funded model of broadcasting.” (Neither would the show’s US remake, which has become one of the most popular shows of all time.) “I don’t think people who are trying to get rid of the BBC have considered for a second how much stuff they love wouldn’t exist without it.” Getting rid of the BBC, he says, would “absolutely” be to the detriment of the country’s cultural landscape. At a time when it feels like comedy is being used as a political football and under threat, how does he feel about its future? “For a while I was like, I just don’t understand why I’m constantly hearing about people complaining about how you can’t say anything any more,” he says. “I’m bored of people talking to me about ‘cancel culture’; as soon as somebody mentions it now, I’m just like, ‘Just shut the f*** [up].’ It’s always people that have no idea about comedy and don’t even watch it or do it, who just want to talk about it and talk about it and talk about it.” Kumar gets louder, clearly exasperated by the whole thing. “Every time somebody uses the phrase, it makes me want to tear my own skin off and beat him to death with it.” Kumar recently agreed to take part in a panel discussion, only to be told it was about the dreaded double c-word. “I was like, ‘I’m not f***ing doing it. I’ll cancel that cancel culture panel.’” He laughs. “Maybe that is cancel culture. Refusing to participate in discussions about cancel culture.” ‘Nish Kumar: Your Power, Your Control’ plays at the Hackney Empire on 22 and 23 April and across the UK in May.

(652, '/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/chivalry-review-channel-4-steve-coogan-b2063058.html', 9, 'independent', 'Steve Coogan and Sarah Solemani are perfectly paired in Chivalry', 'A problematic, erotically charged new film about the French resistance (titled A Little Death... geddit?) has attracted the attention of the studio bosses. The producer, Cameron O’Neill (Steve Coogan), himself somewhat compromised by outdated attitudes, is told to sort it out. He drafts in a well-respected feminist filmmaker, “Bobby” Sohrabi (Sarah Solemani), who helps him try to persuade the vile director (Djilali Rez) to reshoot the offending material. During their lively discussion, said director – who has a French accent as obscene as his views on women – drops dead. Then the fun starts. Liberated from the deceased monster – a cold-eyed, vaguely Epsteinesque figure – Cameron and Bobby set about navigating a post-#MeToo Hollywood, trying to gauge what is and isn’t allowed on screen; what words are and are not taboo; under what circumstances are an older man in a position of power and authority allowed to date a younger subordinate female... Thus we find Bobby berating the 50-something Cameron for his relationship with his personal assistant, who is half his age. She’s so young, she dumped him on WhatsApp, as Coogan’s mildly conflicted studio executive explains, with an almost Boris Johnson-like air of wry satisfaction. He claims to have loved her, so what’s the problem? Bobby makes her point by asking him when her birthday is (“Erm, October something?”) and where she’s from (“...er, begins with ‘O’. Oklahoma… Oregon”). Cameron sarcastically suggests she can approve his next prospective partner, and she looks very much like she’d enjoy doing that. We also learn that Cameron has slept with the film’s female lead, a French resistance “honey pot” agent, played by Sienna Miller. She conveys the sour energy of someone who finds the whole ethos of her profession demeaning, while simultaneously rebelling against it. She may have gone to bed with Cameron, but their past, presumably brief, intimacy also means that she can chuck her spiked panties at him and tell him to pay her more. It’s raucous, difficult stuff, trying to find a route through this new ethical landscape. Solemani, Coogan and Miller – nicely supported by Wanda Sykes, Paul Rudd and Lolly Adefope – all do an excellent job of crashing into the contemporary obstacles that make the creative process trickier. Take a line such as “grab my hair and f*** me!”, supposedly uttered in around 1943 by a beautiful French resistance fighter masquerading as a sex worker. Is it still OK? Should the emphasis in the scene be on the pleasure of the Nazi officer (soon to meet his little and bigger death), thus objectifying the woman? Or should it be on the woman herself, who is the more central character? And if it’s on the woman, where should the camera’s gaze fall? And, depending on which, how explicit would be pleasuring be? The compulsory intervention of an intimacy adviser on set slows production down by turning into an ethics seminar, as does a glabrous “woke” actor trying to make himself at ease with playing the sadistic Nazi (given that the Third Reich preferred men not to depilate their body hair). The problem with Chivalry isn’t the topical themes, the dry, witty writing or the wonderfully world-weary pairing of Coogan and Solemani. Both have rather cynical, hard-bitten, direct sorts of personalities, despite their divergent outlooks and origins. That’s all most intriguing and highly engaging. It’s just the sheer audacious scale of the comedy drama’s near-pornographic presentation and profane language that threatens to overwhelm.  There’s one especially trenchant discussion of whether the “C-word” can be legitimately used to describe female genitalia, or parts thereof, or a human being. The dialogue in Chivalry is basically an amalgam of barrack-room swearing, porn-movie set directions and the sort of intimate technical terms you might encounter during a gynaecological case conference. I don’t know whether, in the age of Naked Attraction, Babestation and Nadine Dorries, there are or should be any boundaries around what is seen and heard on TV. But I think Chivalry has helped me find my own boundaries as a viewer. Enough, already.

(653, '/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/the-flight-attendant-season-2-kaley-cuoco-b2062222.html', 9, 'independent', 'Kaley Cuoco shines in wonderful, wonky The Flight Attendant season 2', 'When the new instalment of HBO Max’s madcap comic-thriller The Flight Attendant picks up, Cassie Bowden (Kaley Cuoco) has traded her Manhattan shoebox for an LA bungalow with retro-chic appliances, her imaginary tête-à-tête with a dead one-night stand for a sexy, supportive boyfriend, and her nips of vodka for Alcoholics Anonymous. A little less than a year has passed since season one’s tidy finale, in which Cassie cleared her name over the assassination of a First Class passenger while impressing the agents who surveilled her every move. In season two, she’s a flight attendant who moonlights as a CIA asset in the far-flung destinations that the fictional Imperial Atlantic Airlines services. Besides Cuoco’s perfect screwball performance, the electric pleasure of season one was its pacing: a methodically plotted whodunnit that bounced between storylines at the speed of our protagonist’s own manic energy. Season two sticks to the same formula, unravelling the truth of Cassie’s reinvented life almost as soon as it’s established. First comes her sobriety. Cassie attends AA, yes, but flouts one of its bedrock rules of recovery: no major life changes in the first year. In fact, rule-breaking is a recurring issue. In her CIA work, Cassie constantly oversteps, ingratiating herself with the marks she’s meant only to observe. Her disregard for authority was excusable, if not commendable, when she was fighting for her life in season one. But in season two, Cassie’s defiance is revealed for what it is: a compulsion to be always moving in any direction and to somehow outrun accidents of the past. She’s replaced alcohol with pure recklessness, plus Hot Tamales candy to curb her sugar cravings. The mystery at the heart of the second season takes the same basic shape as season one, only wonkier. Cassie is again being framed, this time by a conspicuous lookalike. But it’s her personal battles that now drive the action. Still suffering from PTSD-induced hallucinations, Cassie’s fragmented subconscious locks her in a room with versions of her former self; party Cassie who was so hammered she fell asleep next to a corpse, teen Cassie who watched her dad drink-drive himself to death and depressed Cassie who doesn’t see a way out. Watching the Cassies bully each other into bad decisions lends the old character fresh depth. She’s still foundering, but without alcohol to distract her, we glimpse how exhausting it is to be both the storm and the sailboat. Most of season one’s supporting characters return for the second outing. Zosia Mamet’s skittish Annie and her resourceful hacker-boyfriend (Deniz Akdeniz). TR Knight as Davey, the brother who compels Cassie to confront lingering family issues. Rosie Perez and Griffin Matthews are both back, but just like in season one, neither gets screen time commensurate with their appeal. And while the new season might be overburdened with subplots, it’s hard to wish away Shohreh Aghdashloo, charming as Cassie’s AA sponsor, or Sharon Stone as her icy, estranged mother. “I’m still flying,” Cassie tells an AA meeting in the first episode of the new season. She means as a flight attendant, but the wordplay is the point of her declaration. As all shows with such efficient first seasons must, the second outing of The Flight Attendant walks the tightrope of modest reinvention, finding more road by shifting away from spycraft in the direction of character study. The result is a less tight whodunnit, but something that remains at its best when Cassie is complicating her own life, doubling down on mistakes while struggling to convince herself and everyone around her that she’s simply cruising. ‘The Flight Attendant’ arrives on Sky Max in the UK on 26 May Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(654, '/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/russian-doll-season-2-review-b2060667.html', 9, 'independent', 'Russian Doll remains a testament to the ingenuity of Natasha Lyonne', 'The idea of “high-concept” television is nothing new. It dates all the way back to the early days ofThe Twilight Zone, those self-contained episodes that hinged on an intriguing but simple proposition. What if the Earth moved closer and closer to the sun, until the oceans began to boil? What if you saw your doppelgänger at a bus stop? What if you looked out your plane window and saw a monster? These ideas are the height of “high-concept”, as was the first season of Netflix’s acclaimed comedy-drama Russian Doll. The show posed a simple question: what if you walked out on your birthday party, got hit by a car and woke up back at the start of festivities once again? The problem with high-concept, of course, is what happens next. It’s why The Twilight Zone (and its spiritual successor, Black Mirror) utilise standalone episodes. The drama plays out and then it ends. As has been proven in years gone by (I’m looking at you, Lost) where the story gets strung out, beyond its apparent resolution, the law of diminishing returns takes effect. So here we have the second season of Russian Doll, which picks up where the first ended: with Nadia and Alan (Natasha Lyonne and Charlie Barnett) seemingly escaping their infinite day, ploughing on through separate timelines where they’re both alive, safe and together. But obviously Russian Doll is far too classy a show to simply rehash its Groundhog Day premise, so the new season picks a fresh (but well-trodden) concept to heighten: time travel.  Lyonne (one of the most charismatic actors at work right now) is back, writing, directing and starring as Nadia Vulvokov, an acerbic genius, stuck in a cycle of crazy occurrences. “Inexplicable things happening is my entire modus operandi,” she announces, as a subway train delivers her back to the months in 1982 before her own birth (“What is this, some kind of Eighties flash mob?” she wonders, aloud, in the carriage). There, she finds her consciousness fused with that of her mother Lenora (Chloë Sevigny), whose breakdown has hung over Russian Doll from the beginning. Alan, meanwhile, is taking his own train, back into the past. It may somewhat lack the clarity of the first season’s Matryoshka structure, but this new iteration of Russian Doll (or just Doll, if you’re really hot on your sanctions) is just as dynamic and existentially curious as its predecessor. Russian Doll feels, to me at least, like one of the last pre-Covid artefacts. Back in 2019, the idea of living an endless day, trapped in an apartment with a constantly shrinking number of people around you, seemed like a harmless fantasy. But the intrusion of the pandemic has not just altered that narrative but afforded three years to cook up this return to Nadia’s world, which introduces big names, like District 9’s Sharlto Copley and Schitt’s Creek’s Annie Murphy to the mix. The results are, quite literally, bigger, if not better: episodes in the first season ran to a tantalising 25 minutes, whereas here they occupy a half hour. “We Vulvakovs exist in the sweet spot where paranoia meets hyperinflation,” Nadia muses, over her family’s missing fortune. Inflation is clearly on the brain. Even though this second outing can’t quite replicate the hypnotic rhythmicality of the 2019 series, it is testament to the ingenuity of Lyonne (and her co-creators, Amy Poehler and Leslye Headland) that the show does not really try to. This new season is less a Russian doll than a Fabergé egg. Gilded, ornate, almost ostentatiously clever and beguiling, but with that crucial surprise – a nugget of emotional clarity – that emerges as the egg is cracked.

(655, '/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/better-call-saul-review-6-b2058271.html', 9, 'independent', 'Better Call Saul makes a masterful return without skipping a beat', 'Has there ever been a TV series as masterful as Better Call Saul at staying three steps ahead of its audience? Even more so than its predecessor Breaking Bad, Saul has carved out a niche doing exactly this – slowly teasing its fans with pieces of a puzzle, only to reveal what it is you’re watching hours down the line. The series returns to screens today following a hiatus of two years, with the sixth and final season having been delayed due to the pandemic (as well as shorter disruptions stemming from Bob Odenkirk’s on-set heart attack). You wouldn’t know by watching, however – it picks itself back up without missing a beat. The season premiere picks up immediately after the end of season four, with Lalo Salamanca (Tony Dalton) wrongly presumed dead after a bloody raid on his Mexican home. Nacho (Michael Mando) has been immediately pegged as the inside man, and goes on the run for his life. Meanwhile, north of the border, Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk), now fully embracing his “Saul Goodman” persona, conspires with his now wife Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn) to enact devious vengeance against his former employer Howard Hamlin (Patrick Fabian). Saul has always been somewhat divided in its storytelling. On the one hand, you have the legal mischief surrounding McGill/Goodman and the eccentricities of the Albuquerque legal scene. On the other, you have the power struggle between factions of the New Mexico drug cartel, which plays more like a traditional crime drama and gives plenty of screen time to returning Breaking Bad favourites Mike (Jonathan Banks), Gus (Giancarlo Esposito) and Hector Salamanca (Mark Margolis). These two worlds often dovetail and intersect one another, but not always: season six begins with two episodes that keep them firmly apart. With tension mounting in the underworld plotline, the decision to embroil Jimmy and Kim in an elaborate act of character assassination – motivated entirely by petty spite – might seem, on paper, like something of a distraction. But there’s nothing Saul does better than show a scheme at work. We watch as they set up the dominoes, unaware exactly how they’re going to fall. As always, the cleverness in the writing is matched by exemplary talent elsewhere: Saul remains one of the best directed and best acted shows on TV. For my money, the standouts are Seehorn – by turns endearing and flinty; impossible to get a read on – and the wickedly charismatic Dalton, but there’s not a weak link in the bunch. With just 12 more episodes to go, it’s clear that Better Call Saul is ramping up for its endgame. But if the first two episodes are anything to judge it by, it’s going to go about that the same way it has the rest of its story. Slowly. Methodically. The devil is in the details, but so is everything else. It’s a pleasure to be three steps behind.

(656, '/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/doctor-who-review-easter-special-yaz-b2058070.html', 9, 'independent', 'Are the Doctor and Yaz on the cusp of their big romantic moment?', '“If it was going to be anyone, it’d be you,” are the words Doctor Who fans will cling to after Sunday’s Easter special. Showrunner Chris Chibnall teased that Jodie Whittaker’s (and, indeed, his) penultimate episode would portray the “developing” relationship between the Time Lord and her companion Yaz (Mandip Gill); the episode may be titled “Legend of the Sea Devils”, but it might as well be called “Yaz and the Doctor: Will They or Won’t They?” The answer, it seems, is yet to be determined. The backdrop is a village in 19th-century China, where the steely Madame Ching has stolen a statue and unintentionally released a swarm of Sea Devils. These baddies were first faced by Jon Pertwee’s Doctor in 1972 and, in the nicest possible way, you can definitely tell they’re a BRTD (before Russell T Davies) creation. They might’ve been nipped and tucked, but as with a lot of old Who monsters, these bug-eyed lizard monsters are too cartoonish to be truly scary. Fortunately, the episode features an excellent ensemble cast. Crystal Yu brings a sharp edge to warrior Madame Ching, while Marlowe Chan-Reeves is sweet and immensely likeable as Ying Ki. It’s easy to rag on Doctor Who for its CGI, but the effects here are impressive, with plenty of stunning shots of sweeping seas and alien armies. The story is compelling enough, but it ultimately ends up feeling like background noise to the romance. After Yaz finally confessed her feelings to Dan (John Bishop) in the New Year special, the Doctor took her companion by the hand, the words “Yaz, with me” flowing off her tongue as if they were the most natural thing in the world. It turns out that preventing the end of the human race makes a great backdrop for Serious Relationship Chats, with the Doctor telling Yaz that “dates are not something I really do” without stopping to meet her eye. You can practically see Yaz’s heart drop. But then, those words. “If I was going to, believe me, it’d be with you,” the Doctor says. “I think you’re one of the greatest people I’ve ever known.” The titular Sea Devils It’s a beautifully tender scene, but step back and there’s a hollowness. After all, there’s a clock ticking for the Doctor. She was told last series that her journey is “heading to its end” and knows time is running out. The audience, having read the endless speculation about who will replace Whittaker when she bows out at the end of the year, knows it too. Yaz and the Doctor will probably get their big romantic moment in Whittaker’s last episode; after all this hinting, it would be cruel not to. But given the Doctor is going to regenerate, it feels like a bit of a “bury your gays” moment – and look how that turned out for Killing Eve. “I wish this would go on forever,” the Doctor says. Fans will probably feel the same.

Where will this creative obsession end? A horrifying feature-length reconstruction of the life of the bloke who shoved a flare in his arse at the Euros final? A forensic six-part series about the origins of the cat bin lady?! The Thief, His Wife and the Canoe is the latest instalment in ITV’s campaign to dramatise every crime committed in the United Kingdom, however quotidian. It tells the story of John and Anne Darwin, played by top TV talents Eddie Marsan and Monica Dolan, a Hartlepool couple who made headlines through the 2000s after John faked his death in a canoeing accident. John is a dreamer, a man who, in the words of his wife (who narrates proceedings throughout), would “buy a Range Rover he couldn’t afford, and then spend £3,000 on a personalised number plate; all before we’d got the gas connected”. But those aspirations land him in hot water – and then the very cold water of the North Sea – as the debts mount up and his options dwindle. The fact that John Darwin will always be known to the press and public as “Canoe Man” indicates the farcical quality of this, if not wholly victimless, then certainly bodyless, crime. But writer Chris Lang understands that the audience cannot be expected to sympathise with anonymous insurance companies, so the conflict instead centres on the married couple. Marsan’s John is a Walter Mittyish bully, coercing his wife into the plan. “I’d genuinely prefer to end it all than face the shame of bankruptcy,” he tells her, as he forces her into his baffling plot, “I just couldn’t bear it.” Dolan’s Anne, therefore, becomes a truculent participant in the ruse. “No one is queuing up for a woman like you, Anne,” he tells her on the eve of his departure, leaving the audience begging her to weigh the canoe down with stones.  Marsan – who looks, let’s face it, like nobody in the world other than Eddie Marsan – brings a clownish physicality to John. As the buffoon emerges from the waves in a tight-fitting wet suit, he looks like a stage of evolution somewhere between man and haddock. Dolan, meanwhile, imbues Anne with buttoned-up fury: her reluctance to join the scheme gives way to a mania of frustration as things snowball out of control. But for all the Punch and Judy elements, and the inherent comedy of the set-up (John returns to live in a bedsit next door, slipping into his former home for morning fry-ups via a coffin-shaped interconnecting passage), The Thief, His Wife and the Canoe never catches fire. The juxtaposition of the ludicrous crime with a gritty depiction of a manipulative, controlling relationship doesn’t work: it leaves both sides of that drama feeling oddly unsatisfying. Not funny enough to lean into its dark comedic credentials, but not serious enough to say anything about domestic abuse. “This is the life I really want,” John tells Anne, as he sits alone, locked in a bedsit playing dirty video games, “with you.” The Darwins’ life in Hartlepool, before they manage to flee to the more exotic climes of Panama, has a poignant quality of bathos. But as the drama, and Anne’s life, unravels, the exceptional mundanity of the crime and its perpetrators gives way to something bleaker and more procedural. It’s hard to watch the bereaved (but not bereaved) Anne tearfully screaming into the roiling waves off Seaton Carew without asking: did the story of the Canoe Man need to leave me this depressed?

(658, '/arts-entertainment/tv/features/sian-clifford-interview-fleabag-life-after-life-b2060199.html', 9, 'independent', 'Sian Clifford: ‘The scripts that I get sent are never my age’', 'Sian Clifford is not sure what the worst way to die would be. “I guess none of us know,” says the actor matter-of-factly, displaying an enduring pragmatism that calls to mind her breakout character, Claire, the sister in Fleabag, Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s wonderfully wicked series that propelled its writer and cast to comedy glory. Clifford won a Bafta for her performance. But back to the current morbid topic. It’s perhaps a fittingly gloomy one given the storm raging outside both our windows (“Nothing like being indoors while it’s thundering!”); it’s also a natural question to ask considering Clifford’s latest role in BBC Two’s Life After Life, an adaptation of Kate Atkinson’s novel of the same title. The four-part series, set in England across the two world wars, stars Clifford as Sylvie, stoic mother to Ursula (Thomasin McKenzie). Her daughter has the bad luck of dying at various stages in life, only to be reborn over and over, put through life’s wringer again and again. Stillbirth; influenza; car crash; defenestration; botched surgery; murder. Ursula seemingly cannot escape this especially grim brand of deja-vu. Sylvie can be cruel, but she is at heart just a mum trying her best. She joins a growing cohort of onscreen mothers daring to be flawed. “There is an overwhelming notion that mothers can’t be anything less than perfect. And women, to be honest, I think are perceived in that same way too,” says Clifford. Life After Life is her biggest part yet, and one she confesses to being extremely anxious about. “I want to be good in it, to do the character justice,” she says. Her nerves are unnecessary. In a way, Sylvie is a perfect embodiment of Clifford’s appeal: as an actor, she excels in restraint. Beneath the dour demeanour of her characters simmers a stew of emotions. You can sense Clifford under the iciest surface, vulnerable and empathetic. We witnessed this skill firsthand in Fleabag, in which she played the scene-stealing sister of Waller-Bridge’s titular character. As Claire, Clifford was pivotal in many of the show’s sharpest scenes. “I look like a pencil!” is a highlight, as is her cheerful life advice: “I take all the negative emotions; I bottle them and bury them and they never come out. I’ve basically never been better.” Clifford’s talent for deadpan comedy didn’t go unnoticed. Since then, many of her roles have shared the same description: stern, tight-lipped lady. And although her follow-up part in Quiz was more quietly dramatic than laugh-out-loud hysterical, her performance as Diana Ingram – one half of the couple accused of cheating their way to the top prize on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? in 2001 – contained comic notes of Claire. As did her portrayal of the tough-as-nails mum to Maisie Williams in Sky One’s off-grid survivalist drama Two Weeks to Live. Sylvie in Life After Life is yet another ball of tension. But Clifford doesn’t see her roles as similar at all. “I suppose they are,” she eventually concedes. “There is probably something tightly wound about a lot of them but if they were to unravel, they would spin off in very different directions as women.” It is not hard to see Clifford herself as one such spin-off. The actor carries a whiff of Claire, Sylvie and Diane about her. “I’m psychotic with a spreadsheet!” she declares, sipping diligently from a water bottle throughout our conversation. Later, the actor later apologises for the “chaos” in the background, gesturing over her shoulder to what can only be described as a perfectly ordered bookshelf. But at other times, Clifford displays something far less expected: a new age-y openness to alternate lives and reincarnation. Two things that her typically no-nonsense characters would scoff at.  Clifford stars as a flawed but loving mother in BBC’s adaptation of ‘Life After Life’  “I do feel like there is a version of my life in which I’m a ballerina,” says Clifford, who took dance classes as a child. “I’m always told I have ballerina’s feet.” She throws her head back with a guttural, very un-Claire laugh. Indeed, a ballerina’s life might’ve awaited Clifford – and her high arches – had she been able to tolerate her “horrible” teacher. “I’m really allergic to bullies and people who are unkind. Even as a five-year-old, I knew I didn’t have to put up with this,” Clifford says, adding she had the same problem during her brief stint in Brownies. “If you have to strip someone else of their power in order for you to be powerful, you’re in big trouble and you need some help. Especially if you’re doing it to a child!” Clifford is a living, breathing, acting testament to the advice that if you fail, try again. And then once more. The actor auditioned for a place at London’s Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts three times before she was finally accepted. She never once thought of giving up, an early example of her steely resolve. For her third audition, Clifford performed a monologue from Joan of Arc; she pulls the exact copy out from a shelf above her head to show me the annotations she scribbled in the margins when she was 20 (“No one needs to see what I’ve written there!” she cackles). By then, Clifford knew – almost inexplicably – that she would get in on that third try. “I have a lot of moments in my life where I feel a very, very deep intuitive knowing. And that was one of them. I can’t really expand any more than that. It is a knowing.” ‘We met on day one [of drama school] and became friends on day three,’ Clifford says of her long-time friendship with ‘Fleabag’ creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge It was at Rada that she met Waller-Bridge. “We met on day one but became friends on day three,” says Clifford. She had been initially “wary” of Waller-Bridge because they were both from Ealing, but “different parts” of Ealing, adding that “we definitely had different kinds of upbringings”. She laughs, “I don’t know why I’d hold it against her that she was from my part of town.” Clifford doubts Waller-Bridge – “the most accepting, non-judgemental person I’ve ever met” – had the same reservations. Their friendship was forged on the London Underground, on the Central line back home from class. “At the end of that 45-minute journey, I knew that this was one for life. I don’t have another friendship like it.” Clifford is most effusive when talking about her co-stars: whether it is “my beloved” James McArdle who plays her husband in Life After Life, or Matthew Macfadyen, her onscreen partner in Quiz and “the nicest man in all of England”. Of Saoirse Ronan, with whom she stars in the forthcoming thriller See How They Run, Clifford cannot be more complimentary. “She really is the greatest actor in a generation.” Access unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trial Clifford wears her heart on her sleeve. “I’m like a tap, to be honest,” she says. “It’s harder for me not to get emotional in scenes. I’m trying to rein that in because it’s not always helpful.” But the tap proved helpful when shooting Life After Life. Throughout the series, we see Ursula’s multiple births, ergo Sylvie’s multiple labours, a number of which end in stillbirth. The birth scenes alone took two days to film. “It was daunting,” recalls Clifford. Seeing her telegraph pain so palpably, you wonder if she is mining some personal tragedy of her own – but the actor insists she isn’t. “I have to imagine it’s actually happening. It has to be authentic,” she says. “That’s not to say I’m a method actor at all because I don’t advocate for that.” And anyway, she adds, “I don’t think there is any scenario equivalent to a stillbirth.” Clifford dreamt of being an actor before she was able to articulate it. At six years old, she was watching her sister’s am-dram performance of The Little Mermaid when she came to the sudden realisation that she was meant to be on stage. Clifford then entered the am-dram world, but “thrived” in private. “It wasn’t something that anyone knew about. I didn’t have a great time at school so I kept my head below the parapet,” she says, turtling her neck between her shoulders. Although Clifford mostly grew out of this childhood aversion to an audience – a career in acting necessitates that – nothing could prepare her for the spotlight that Fleabag brought. “I’m not going to lie, it was intoxicating being in that environment,” she recalls. “But the fact it happened later in my life and that I did it with my friend helped keep me grounded.” Nevertheless, Clifford says she is “still dealing with own neuroses” surrounding her career. “I know that the pressure I feel is a fiction – and as soon as I remind myself that, it disperses. But there’s definitely a part of me that is still like, ‘Are you sure that I should have a seat at this table?’” That incredulity was crystallised in Clifford’s 2020 Bafta acceptance speech, in which she tripped over her words with charming bemusement. Honestly, she hadn’t expected to win. And not in the way that every actor says they didn’t – Clifford genuinely thought she didn’t stand a chance. “The one thing worse than not winning an award is winning an award and not having anything to say,” she says now, hands to her cheeks in shock-horror like an Edvard Munch painting incarnate. “I was gobsmacked.” Clifford speaks fondly of her ‘Quiz’ co-star Matthew Macfadyen, ‘the nicest man in England’  The actor has kept her feet on the ground throughout everything. The fame. The awards circuit. The general hoopla of it all. As she said, it’s partly thanks to finding fame later in life. That is, if mid-thirties counts as late, which it inexplicably does in the entertainment industry. Clifford says she feels the sharp jab of ageism now more than ever. “The scripts that I get sent are never my age,” she says. “I always get scripts for characters in their late forties or fifties. I know it sounds silly but I just don’t feel that inside. I still feel very young-spirited.” Clifford tries to take it as an endorsement; after all, it’s true that she is remarkable at conveying the sort of sensibility associated with adulthood. “I try not to take offence and treat it entirely as a compliment that I get these older parts, but I’ve certainly noticed it more now.” It being, you know, “the age thing”. Part of the problem, she explains, is that there are so few parts for the in-between stage of a woman’s life. “There’s the matriarchal character or the young hot one. There’s very little in the middle,” she says. The exception is almost always with “stuff written by women”. Although Clifford sees her roles as being different at their core, the actor is still itching to do something totally new. “I’m longing for a part that is a bit wilder. Something a bit more unhinged,” she says. “I’m really desperate to play a villain. Or someone who is utterly authentically joyful.” Over the course of one conversation, it becomes clear that Clifford is the latter – despite what her stony-faced characters may suggest. “I’m just incredibly enthusiastic,” she grins. ‘Life After Life’ debuts on BBC Two on Tuesday 19 April at 9pm.

(659, '/arts-entertainment/tv/features/laura-linney-interview-ozark-b2057940.html', 9, 'independent', 'Laura Linney: ‘Nothing is more dangerous than ignorance and arrogance’', 'Midway through our conversation, Laura Linney flashes the kind of smile that can’t be faked. Big, dimpled; a dazzling sunrise of warmth. The triple-Oscar-nominated star has begun telling me the story of how she met her husband. It was 2004, the year after Love Actually, in which she played the pining office worker, Sarah. Linney was flying to the Telluride Film Festival, where her latest film, Kinsey – about the pioneering sexologist Alfred Kinsey – was to be unveiled. When she landed, she was introduced to a local real estate agent who was helping out with the festival. His name was Marc Schauer. “He was assigned to make sure I got from point A to point B on time and in one piece,” remembers Linney, who had brought her mum along for the ride. “I was like, ‘This guy seems like a nice guy.’ I was just relieved he wasn’t awkward or needy or nervous, which can happen with people who are assigned to you.” There was a frisson. “At one point, I remember thinking, ‘Am I attracted to my handler?’ And I was like, ‘Oh Laura, stop, just stop it.’ I had been single for a while and I thought, ‘Well, how nice. You’re attracted to someone? How sweet.’” After that weekend, she emailed him. “There was no torrid affair,” she says, eyes widening, but they were in touch regularly. “Then we both started to get a little confused.” He asked her where they stood. “I said, ‘Well, I don’t know if we’re friends, or if we’re more than friends. You’re my handler; what do I know?’” They agreed to meet in Chicago, the next city on her Kinsey publicity tour. “And that was that,” she says. “Sixteen years later, with a child and a home.” Talking to Linney, you get a sense she’s always like this. While so many film stars hide their real lives and feelings, Linney does not. Beneath a pair of black, thick-rimmed glasses, the 58-year-old is breezy, uncontrived; conversation flows. From the amount of times she says “I love”, you might conclude she’s a bit of a luvvie. She’s not. Even on a laptop screen – she’s Zooming from her home in New York – she has an air of kindness and self-contained confidence. When I bring up how little we see women in their fifties with young children represented on screen, she stops me dead in my tracks. “I don’t care,” she says, laughing disarmingly. “I don’t feel a desire, you know, for the voice of the older mother to be heard.” On screen, Linney has mastered the nuances of women under stress; characters who seem cheerful, even disconcertingly over-bright, but slowly reveal inner turmoil. There’s the artificially perfect wife opposite Jim Carrey in The Truman Show (1998). The tormented divorcee in The Squid and the Whale (2005). The uptight single mum in You Can Count on Me (2000), and the troubled playwright squabbling with her brother (Philip Seymour Hoffman) in The Savages (2007), both of which earned Linney Oscar nominations. Her other nod came for Kinsey, in which she played Clara McMillen, the famous sex researcher’s wife. It’s the film of which she’s most proud. “I love everything about that movie,” she says. The role we’re here to discuss today, however, is Wendy Byrde, the noxious matriarch in Ozark, a Netflix drama that has grown in reputation with each series. What began as an apparent hand-me-down from Breaking Bad, revolving around a middle-class accountant tumbling into a life of crime, is now brilliant in its own right: a twisty, propulsive thriller, drenched in moody-blue darkness and leavened with sharp humour. For the uninitiated, the first season followed Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) and his family – wife, teenage daughter, younger son – after they were forced to uproot from Chicago to Missouri, specifically the serpentine Lake of the Ozarks, to find a way to launder $500m for a Mexican drug cartel. There were culture clashes. Murders. Affairs. By the midway point of the fourth and final season – the show returns for its last seven episodes on 29 April – the Byrdes had become a full-blown criminal enterprise, stockpiling money in their newly built casinos and dealing heroin with the Kansas City mob. Wendy’s transformation has been the most radical. Where once she was simply Marty’s disillusioned wife, now she’s the icy, unpredictable villain of the piece. Look beyond that spoonful-of-sugar smile and she is evil incarnate, a modern-day Lady Macbeth capable of killing her own brother or offering up her son to the FBI. Jason Bateman and Laura Linney in ‘Ozark’  “There’s a lot that I love about this character,” says Linney. “She is constantly changing, going deeper and deeper into a vulnerable place where a survival instinct hijacked her entire being. Which I think fuelled her intellectual decisions, her emotional outbursts, her strategy. She is very shrewd but makes terrible decisions. She’s immature; she’s not wise. And then, as the series goes on, you learn about her mental illnesses and her family: that allowed me a wider berth in which to veer out into more impulsive behaviours.” When Linney first saw the script, however, she thought Wendy needed more depth. The role, she told The Guardian in 2017, felt “typical” of “a female character in a male-driven show”. She asked that the part be rewritten. “I had no problem being a sideline to Jason Bateman under any circumstances,” she explains. “I just wanted to make sure that sideline was interesting. If I was going to commit to a multi-year endeavour, I would need to be able to bring something to it that would keep me engaged. If you have just one character that never changes, you can become subconsciously disinterested and start to detach.” Access unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trial Character development wasn’t the only stumbling block. In January 2014, Linney became a mother for the first time at the age of 49 (“I was very old”). The idea of being away from her son, Bennett, on location in Atlanta for long stretches was unappealing. Hence why she had her Ozark contract stipulate that for every seven days she worked, she would take four off to go home to Brooklyn. I felt a little intrusive on ‘Frasier’ – it was a very emotional time for them Motherhood, says Linney, has made everything “more enjoyable”. “While it’s not easy being a mother and trying to handle a career, and having to go away on location and all that,” she explains, “it certainly fills the time with a meaning. It’s grounded me, and there’s something about being tethered to people you want to be tethered to.” Among these are the people working on Ozark, who, for one episode in this final series, encouraged her to direct for the first time. “Jason and our producer, Patrick Markey, had been trying to get me to do [it] since the first season,” she explains. “I’ve always sort of shied away from it, and the last season came around and they forced my hand. I was surrounded by a crew of people who I had been working with for years, who had a vested interest in me doing well.” The episode, titled “A Pound of Flesh and Still Kicking”, leads into what will surely be one of the most chewed-over TV denouements since Breaking Bad, with Marty and Wendy Byrde’s bloody past bound to catch up with them. Alongside Liam Neeson in 2004’s ‘Kinsey’  Ozark, of course, is not the first enormously popular series involving Linney to draw to a close in a blaze of excitement. In 2004, she appeared in the finale of Frasier, the wonderfully erudite NBC sitcom that won 37 Emmys. “I did six episodes of Frasier because I had no idea what it was like to be on a sitcom,” says Linney. “There was something about it that massaged your wit. I was only there for the last episodes, so I felt a little intrusive that I was joining this very tight-knit group of people who were ending an 11-year run. It was a very emotional time for them. So I tried to just be as kind and, in some ways, invisible as I could be, so they could have their time together. That’s a big thing, as I now know with ending Ozark. It is a very, very special time.” Frasier is supposedly coming back, I say. “There are rumours,” she replies. “I don’t know whether they’re true or not.” Television, on the whole, has been very good to Linney. Think of her soulful, Emmy-winning turn as Abigail Adams, wife of the second US president, in the HBO miniseries John Adams (2008). Or her carefully modulated performance as a dutiful Minneapolis schoolteacher diagnosed with incurable cancer in Showtime’s The Big C (2010), for which she also won an Emmy. Before all that, though, was her astonishing portrayal of the apple-cheeked, straitlaced Mary Ann Singleton in the 1993 adaptation of Armistead Maupin’s Tales of the City. The series, which followed the Midwestern naïf as she was seduced by Swinging Seventies San Francisco, was groundbreaking in its heartfelt depiction of queer culture. “It was really culturally significant,” says Linney, who named her son Bennett Armistead Schauer in homage to the book’s author. “The younger generations don’t quite realise – when that first came out, no one had ever seen anything like it on television. Nothing like that had ever been allowed. Armistead, who now lives in England by the way, is the cornerstone of American gay literature. What he has given to a countless number of people is really significant.” As Mary Ann Singleton in the 1993 miniseries adaptation of ‘Tales of the City’  I ask if she’s surprised that, in the years since Tales of the City aired, the treatment of the LGBT+ community, particularly trans people, has worsened in some respects. “It just makes no sense,” she says. “The Americans are just passing all of these laws that I find really offensive, and for some reason, the swirl of distrust just keeps going around and around. It’s just wrong, deeply wrong. I don’t understand why people would want to suppress such a loving, kind, good community. It’s just such a disservice to every community.” She takes a breath. “It’s just awful and it’s ignorant; there’s nothing more dangerous to me than ignorance and arrogance. Those two things coupled together, you know, is a nasty engine.” Linney speaks just as passionately about the arts, which have taken a well-publicised hit during Covid. “It’s one of the most valuable tools we have,” she says. “I’ve never understood why [the US government] doesn’t encourage the resourcing of the arts, not just for the mental health of our citizens but for health in general. Money towards the arts is money well spent.” It’s not entirely surprising Linney feels this way. A theatre person by her own admission, she’s the daughter of playwright Romulus Linney, the winner of two National Critics’ awards. “I grew up in the theatre,” she explains. “It’s my longest relationship.” After graduating from Brown, having transferred from Northwestern University, Linney spent four years studying acting at the Juilliard School in New York. Now she’s been nominated for five Tonys; her many Broadway credits include The Crucible, Time Stands Still and The Little Foxes. “I’m most comfortable on the stage,” says Linney. “I love how demanding it is of your concentration, of your body, of your voice, of your mind, of your spirit.” Nothing has been more demanding than starring in an adaptation of the American novelist Elizabeth Strout’s My Name Is Lucy Barton, longlisted for the Booker Prize in 2016, adapted by Rona Munro and directed by Richard Eyre. A daunting 37-page monologue about a writer confronting her past, it came to London’s Bridge Theatre in 2018 and was carried by Linney’s luminously subtle solo performance. “It was the scariest thing I’ve ever done,” says Linney. “I was terrified. It was just an insane thing to do.” Alongside Colin Firth in 2003’s ‘Love Actually’ Of course, there’ll be some viewers in the UK for whom Laura Linney is forever tied to Richard Curtis’s Love Actually (2003), a film that is either a problematic exercise in lachrymosity or a life-affirming celebration of romance, depending on your cringe threshold. Linney is a huge fan. “I’m so fond of that movie and I had such a wonderful time making it,” she says. “Deeply loved everyone involved in it.” She was already friends with Liam Neeson, with whom she had starred in The Crucible. “Alan Rickman became a mentor: really treasured and cherished. Colin Firth and I have remained friends over the years.” The film, she says, worked because of Curtis. Yes, people accused it of being “very, overly saccharine, but Richard has such a unique optimism about love. He’s not embarrassed by love and loving and being loved, and there’s something so pure about that. That’s why that movie really works.” Linney’s face lights up again. “I loved it.” ‘Ozark’ returns to Netflix for its final episodes on Friday 29 April Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

The real estate reality show returned for its fifth season on Friday (22 April), with one scene showing boss Jason Oppenheim leaving the office to put an offer to a client over the phone. However, eagle-eyed viewers spotted that while Oppenheim was seemingly speaking to his client, his camera app could clearly be seen to be open on his phone’s screen. Viewers instantly spotted the moment and wrote about it on Twitter, with one comment writing: “My vibe today is Jason talking to his camera pretending to call a client.” “Highlight of the new season of Selling Sunset is Jason going outside for an ‘important phone call’ and the camera zooming in to him having the camera app open,” one tweet read. Another commenter wrote: “Jason Oppenheim ‘on a phone call’ during a scene in the new season of Selling Sunset. From what I see though … his camera app is open.” While some fans pointed out that iPhones can continue calls while other apps are open, many viewers argued that, given Selling Sunset is a constructed reality show, he was likely “pretending” to make the call. One commenter said: “This show was created by the creators of Laguna Beach and The Hills, which notoriously faked phone calls.” “I cringed so hard when I saw this,” one viewer wrote. “Lmfaoooooo how did I miss that?!” another commented.

The venue, which calls itself “Williamsburg’s original queer bar”, was showing the final episode of season 14, where Angeria Paris VanMichaels, Bosco, Daya Betty, Lady Camden and Willow Pill were competing to be named America’s next drag superstar. *Drag Race spoilers below – you have been warned* In footage shared on Instagram by filmmaker Elvira Lind, the actor could be seen watching intently as RuPaul announced that Willow was the winner, after beating Lady Camden in the final lip-sync. Another attendee tweeted: “While watching the Drag Race finale at a gay bar in Brooklyn, a bearded man pushed past me, stood next to me, and cheered on the show. It was Oscar Isaac.” The news excited fans, one of whom tweeted: “What a good day to be an Oscar Isaac fan and a Drag Race fan.” “Oh to be in a bar in New York with Oscar Isaac watching RuPaul’s Drag Race finale,” another commented. As she was named Drag Race champion, Willow shouted out her fellow contestant Kornbread, who was forced to pull out of the competition after injuring herself in a challenge. “I really want to thank my family and my friends – and most of all, I need to thank Kornbread’s ankle,” she said. In the finale, which was recorded in Las Vegas in front of a live audience, each of the top five queens performed an original song and dance number.

On the new season of Netflix’s real estate reality show, which dropped on the platform on Friday (22 April), property broker Herman alleged that she and Affleck had matched just before he rekindled his relationship with fiancé Jennifer Lopez. “Remember when Ben Affleck went viral because he sent some girl,” Chrishell Stause said, with Herman replying: “He may or may not have been texting me.” She said that Affleck had asked her out for coffee a few times, but she never went, with Stause joking: “You could have foiled Bennifer.” “It was right before that,” Herman said. “So, maybe that wouldn’t have happened. We have the Boston connection. So that was his opening pick-up line.” Stause read through the pair’s messages, saying: “So he asked you out, you were very sweet and cute but you said, ‘No’.” However, Affleck’s representatives denied the claims, telling People that the actor hasn’t been on Raya for years. Affleck rekindled his relationship with Lopez last year “Raya has confirmed that he has not been an active member for several years,” they said. Affleck began dating Lopez in spring 2021, having originally been in a relationship with the singer and actor from 2002 to 2004.

On Thursday (21 April), the Homes Under the Hammer presenter shared a video to social media explaining that he was in hospital after experiencing chest pains he had initially believed to be due to asthma or long Covid. Instead, doctors found that his heart was surrounded by “a massive amount of fluid”, which was preventing it from working. He had emergency surgery that night and was later told that he’d had “hours to live” when he was operated on. Speaking to OK! from the hospital, Roberts said that the incident was “the nearest thing to not being here that’s ever happened to me”. He was seen within 45 seconds of arriving at the hospital, where it was discovered that his blood pressure was half that of a healthy person. “It was severe,” he said. “My liver and my kidneys were down to 30 per cent of their normal operational capacity.” Roberts was given local anaesthetic, before doctors drained a litre and a half of fluid from his lungs with a large syringe. “I watched as they drew out syringe after syringe after syringe of this liquid,” the property expert said. “I was awake for this, but I was bit woozy. There was a tube that went in through my chest cavity, down into the sack around my heart.” Roberts said that doctors suspected he had an underlying respiratory problem that had spread to the heart, adding: “It remains to be seen whether I get full function back of my liver and kidneys.

The comedian shot to fame on the ITV talent show in 2013, where she won over the judges and public with her impersonations of stars such as Stacey Solomon, Cheryl Cole and Katie Price. On Friday (22 April), Lewis appeared on GB News to discuss the story of how she and husband Joel Ryan lost £90,000 by investing her money in a fake stockbroker company. However, she shocked the show’s presenters after concluding her segment by claiming that she had just found out Ryan, with whom she shares two children, had been cheating on her. “There are mini scams going on all the time, but do you know what’s ironic?” Lewis said. “Stuck with my husband through this whole thing, got through it and then last night I found out he was cheating on me with his best friend’s girlfriend.” Host Patrick Christys looked taken aback, saying: “Gosh, right.” “So you know what? I wish I’d gone there and then, because he put me in that situation, and now he’s put me in this situation. I’m devastated,” Lewis said. Asked whether she was alright, she continued: “I will be. I’m still in shock and numb, but you know what? I’ll get through it. I have to, I’ve got two children.” After saying that she felt like “such an idiot again” and being reassured by the presenters, Lewis dabbed at her eyes and impersonated Katie Price, saying: “Oh well, looks like another divorce, what can I say? I love that.” In a statement shared with GB News (via MailOnline), Ryan denied the allegations made by his wife. “I haven’t had an affair and I totally deny all of the claims made against me,” he said. “I sent some messages to a friend’s partner and I hugely regret sending them, but I did not cheat or have an affair.

The new series, which was released on Friday (15 April), follows Tory MP and immigration minister James Whitehouse (Rupert Friend), in the wake of revelations that he cheated on his wife Sophie (Sienna Miller) with his parliamentary aide Olivia (Aladdin’s Naomi Scott).  However, James’s situation quicky becomes more serious when he is accused of rape. The scene in which James discovers the allegation is the one that has been highlighted and posted on social media.  It shows him flying backwards in slow motion after he hears the news, as if he’s been hit by an invisible force. The scene, directed by SJ Clarkson, is designed to reflect an invisible gut punch. Many viewers shared the scene on Twitter in disbelief. Tweeter @AliArikan wrote: “Anatomy of a Scandal is dreadful and hilarious.

(666, 'https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/23/local-elections-its-partygate-versus-low-council-ta', 1, 'guardian', '  Local elections: ‘It’s Partygate versus low council taxes’ ', 'In many ways, the London borough of Wandsworth is a paradigm of the modern city. On one hand, it is a place where a teenager recently fainted from hunger in a food bank queue. And on the other, it is home to the “sky pool”, a spectacular transparent swimming pool suspended 10 storeys above ground in Nine Elms, and reserved exclusively for the development’s richest residents. The borough is also known for its comparatively low council tax – which, its Conservative-run council boasts, is the lowest average council tax in the country. Wandsworth also claims to be the only local authority in London that is cutting its share of council tax bills. “You look at the housing down here and wonder: ‘How much is for normal people?’ It looks like investment housing more than anything else,” said Yahan Lewis, 53, sitting on a park bench opposite Southside shopping centre after a visit to the jobcentre. “I always think it’s the money borough. It’s all about money. They keep the rates low and people vote for them.” Perhaps that is why, after more than four decades in charge of Wandsworth borough council, the Tories have proved immovable. Despite all three of its parliamentary constituencies being held by Labour – the Tories lost Battersea to Labour in 2017 and Putney two years later – and residents voting for Labour mayor Sadiq Khan, the council has remained firmly in the hands of the Tories. But amid anger over Partygate and as the cost of living crisis bites, this leading Tory council – one of a handful in London still under Conservative control – is on a knife edge. And on 5 May it could turn red for the first time since 1978 – potentially spelling disaster for the Tories and making it a key target for Labour. Robert Hayward, the Tory peer and pollster, said that Wandsworth was home to many of the kinds of traditional Tory voters that were now turning against Boris Johnson – namely, pro-remain women aged between 40 and 55. He also said the Conservatives were trying to make the campaign in the capital about their historic commitment to keep council tax down – and to blame Khan for increases. He says the race remains a close and unpredictable one. “It is Partygate versus low council tax,” he said. “That is essentially what the battle is. There were so many wards which were split or unbelievably close last time. The Labour party actually won more votes than the Tories [but gained them in the wrong places]. If the Conservatives just lose Wandsworth and they do well in other parts of the country, it will be a disappointment, but nothing more than that.” However, he went on: “If it is the top of a broader picture, it becomes emotionally very different.” The latest polling conducted in London suggests that Labour is doing slightly better than in 2018, the last time the same elections took place, but not by a large margin. The party did well that year, in the wake of Theresa May’s disastrous 2017 general election campaign. An Opinium poll for Sky News gave Labour a 20-point lead. Back in 2018, Labour secured a 15-point lead. One senior Tory, a veteran of London politics, said the changing demographics of Wandsworth would make it harder for the Conservatives. There was also increasing weariness over Partygate, he said, adding that more fines for the prime minister could make a difference as polling day approaches. Which is perhaps why Tories in seven London boroughs – including Wandsworth – will be listed as “local Conservatives” on the ballot paper rather than the “Conservative party candidate”, seemingly in an attempt to distance themselves from any toxicity of the national brand. But the Conservatives may struggle to pull in people they have previously counted on. On the newly pedestrianised Old York Road in the centre of the borough, where cyclists whiz past people dining outside delis, cafes and restaurants amid strategically placed planting, Liam Garrett, 30, said he did not know the local elections were coming up. The marketing business owner said he was fed up with all the talk of Partygate, which was “over the top”. He added: “It just needs to end as quickly as possible. There are far more pressing issues.” While he thinks Wandsworth council does a good job, particularly on council tax costs, he does not usually vote in local elections. Daisy Talbot, a 20-year-old Durham University student at home for the Easter holidays, voted Conservative previously, but this time around says she would not feel good about voting for them. “There’s definitely a shift,” she said, adding that, like her, many of her friends in the area would no longer vote Conservative. “Now, given lockdown especially and us being students, we feel like our age group hasn’t had much attention .” During the period when Johnson attended parties in lockdown, some of her friends were expelled from university for mixing. “I would feel guilty if I was complaining all the time and voted for them.” In contrast, she thought Keir Starmer was doing a good job: “He’s becoming a figure I’m much more aware of.” Life is hard for many Wandsworth residents: as people with mortgages start to join the queues for food banks, there is a lot more on people’s minds than parties. Charlotte White, 48, manager of Earlsfield food bank, said housing was a huge issue in the area and people were struggling with increasingly complex problems as a result of the cost-of-living crisis. “It’s not just our numbers that are going up, but the complexity of problems. People are coming in with complicated issues and the support simply isn’t there,” she said. “I think people wanting better solutions to those problems might have an effect on how they vote.”', 'Sat 23 Apr 2022 14.36 BSTLast modified on Sat 23 Apr 2022 14.40 BST'),

Patel toured the hostel, known as Hope House, when she was in Kigali to sign the deal with Rwanda. Her visit was carefully managed by both the Rwandan authorities and the Home Office to present the plan in the best possible light. The proposal has been widely condemned as inhumane, illegal, unworkable and prohibitively expensive. Critics have included Tory MPs and peers, the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) and the archbishop of Canterbury, who said in his Easter Sunday sermon that the scheme “does not stand the judgment of God”. The asylum seekers from the UK will be housed at Hope House, a facility built to provide safe accommodation and a “new family” to between 150 and 190 young people orphaned in the 1994 genocide, when up to 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus died in three months of mass killing. Many of the survivors have now moved out, but those who remain have spent most of their lives in the hostel and have limited resources.  On the day of Patel’s visit, 22 residents were told by authorities they were being taken on a 56-mile round trip to the southern town of Bugesera, where they spent much of the day viewing genocide memorials. After returning to Kigali, they were taken to parliament to see another memorial. They returned to Hope House after the British officials had gone. “This is why we think everything is not done in good faith,” one resident told the Observer. The UK government has said it will pay an initial £120m to the Rwandan government for implementing the plan, but will have to pay additional costs for housing, food and travel. The residents of Hope House, formerly known as the Association of Student Survivors of Genocide (AERG) hostel, have been told they will be rehoused to make room for the asylum seekers sent from Britain. They expressed concerns about their future. “Often, residents who leave the hotel come back after failing to get jobs. It is hard outside here when you don’t have a job,” one told the Observer last week. A second worried that pledges to find them alternative homes would not be fulfilled. “The government is saying it will rent us somewhere else but we don’t believe it,” he said. “They are telling us to go but they haven’t given us money. Remember, some of these survivors lost entire family. Where do they want us to go?” The residents asked not to be named for fear of reprisals. A Rwandan government spokesperson told the Observer that to suggest the Hope Hostel is an orphanage, or is a venue intended to house orphans of the genocide, was “incorrect”. “Hope Hostel was built to accommodate student survivors of genocide but is no longer used for these purposes as most of the residents are adults with jobs and families, and are living independently,” the spokesperson said. “Currently Hope Hostel is hosting a small number of people, the youngest of whom is 29. Some in this group are in the process of graduating from university and college. It has been agreed they will soon leave and become eligible for living allowances until they find employment. [The] AERG has had plans to convert the facility into a commercial hostel for some time.” Audace Mudahemuka, president of AERG, said the hostel was built by Rwandan donors to support student survivors and had “served a wonderful purpose.” “But it was being wound down long before the government contacted us about leasing it for this programme. Only a small fraction of the beds in the hostel were being used, and the facility is expensive to maintain. We were delighted when the government offered to rent the property, as the funds we receive from them will allow us to provide support to hundreds or even thousands of genocide survivors through our other projects across the country’, Mudahemuka said. Officials did not deny reports of the day trip, saying only that “residents at Hope Hostel can come and go as they please.” There are also doubts about Patel’s claim that migrants sent to Rwanda after illegally entering the UK would thrive there if their asylum claims are refused. Reporters who accompanied the home secretary were introduced to a couple from Yemen who ran a successful cafe. Burhan Almerdas, 37, praised the Rwandan people as “welcoming” and said there was a business-friendly local environment. But though Rwanda has been credited with rapid economic growth, some statistics are contested, and the benefits of any new prosperity are not evenly shared. Bapaste Gatsinzi, who sought refuge in Rwanda in 2018 from neighbouring Burundi, said he relocated his family to Uganda recently because life is too “difficult” in Rwanda. “I will also join them next month and try life again,” said Gatsinzi, who lived in the eastern province of Cibitoke, a town that borders Burundi. An Ethiopian refugee who settled in 2018 told the Observer: “It’s hard to survive in Rwanda because the cost of living is very high. I set up a grocery but I don’t have customers. People don’t have money, and I will close soon because I cannot afford rent.” An Eritrean who came to Rwanda in 2017 said he had been unable to find regular work and survived on handouts. Most of his friends have relocated to Uganda, he said. Human rights campaigners have long criticised Rwanda’s veteran leader, Paul Kagame, for his intolerance of dissent, and the refugees who spoke to the Observer requested anonymity. According to officials, Rwanda is already home to more than 130,000 refugees from countries such as Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan. Opposition politicians in Rwanda have criticised the agreement to accept asylum seekers flown from the UK, saying western countries should “own up to international obligations on the migration issues”. In 2019, Rwanda agreed to take in refugees and asylum seekers evacuated from detention centres in Libya. The country also had a shortlived agreement with Israel. Last week, Kagame rejected criticism of the deal. “We are not trading human beings, please. This is not the case. We are actually helping,” he said. “It’s a clearcut issue and it was actually something of an innovation that Rwanda put forth to deal with this migration issue.”', 'Sat 23 Apr 2022 13.13 BSTLast modified on Sat 23 Apr 2022 14.00 BST'),

The health secretary, Sajid Javid, is said to be concerned that vulnerable children are being given gender hormone treatment before alternatives have been explored, according to the Times, and is planning an overhaul of services. It comes after an interim report published last month by the Cass Review, an independent review into the NHS’s gender identity services for children and young people. The review said services have “evolved rapidly and organically” in response to increased demand, but that that has meant they have “not been subjected to some of the normal quality controls” typically applied to new treatments. It added that there is a “lack of consensus and open discussion about the nature of gender dysphoria and therefore about the appropriate clinical response”. Javid is said to have compared political sensitivities around the treatment of young people with gender dysphoria to those that stymied investigations into the Rotherham grooming gangs, the Times reported. Asked about the issue in the Commons this week, Javid said the interim findings of the Cass Review had already shown that NHS services “are too narrow … , overly affirmative, and in fact … are bordering on ideological”. “That is why in this emerging area, of course we need to be absolutely sensitive, but we need to make sure that there is holistic care that is provided, that there’s not a one-way street, and that all medical interventions are based on the best clinical evidence,” he said. There is currently a single specialist service – the Gender Identity Development Service, run by the Tavistock and Portman NHS foundation trust – providing gender identity services for children and young people. The service sees about 2,500 children a year, about 200 of whom are given some form of hormone treatment. In September, the court of appeal upheld the right of the trust to give puberty-blocking drugs to under-16s judged to be mature enough to give informed consent. The report noted that a lack of “routine and consistent” data about who is being referred for treatment means it is “not possible to accurately track” outcomes. A spokesperson for trust told the Times: “Being respectful of someone’s identity does not preclude exploration. “We agree that support should be holistic, based on the best available evidence, and that no assumptions should be made about the right outcome for any given young person.” The Guardian has approached the Department of Health and Social Care for comment.', 'Sat 23 Apr 2022 12.44 BSTLast modified on Sat 23 Apr 2022 13.05 BST'),

Steve Baker, a prominent backbench Tory MP, said voters were repeatedly mentioning the Partygate scandal on the campaign trail and the Conservatives should prepare to “reap the whirlwind” of standing by Johnson. The former Brexit minister, who called for Johnson to quit earlier this week, told the Daily Telegraph it was clear the prime minister was not sincere when he apologised to parliament for breaking lockdown rules, adding: “The problem is the contrition didn’t last much longer than it took to get out of the headmaster’s study. By the time we got to the 1922 Committee meeting that evening it was the usual festival of bombast and orgy of adulation. It took me about 90 seconds to realise he wasn’t really remorseful.” He said members of the cabinet who want the prime minister gone are “sitting there fat, dumb and happy and letting me do the dirty work” rather than risk their careers by publicly trying to force Johnson out of office. The Guardian has reported how MPs believe allies of Tory MPs such as Penny Mordaunt and Jeremy Hunt are already making preparations for leadership bids. Baker has represented Wycombe since 2010 but his seat is now a key target for Labour, with current polling suggesting Sir Keir Starmer’s party would win the constituency if an election was held tomorrow. “People lived under barbaric rules,” Baker said. “They were told that if they deviated one iota from the law they would kill people. And they suffered for it … Meanwhile in No 10, where they should have been obeying both the letter and spirit of the rules, clearly they breached both.” It comes after a report by ITV News said fixed-penalty notices had been emailed to officials who attended a “bring your own booze” drinks event in the Downing Street garden in May 2020 at a time when indoor and outdoor gatherings were banned. Downing Street said on Friday evening that Johnson, who has admitted attending the garden party but insisted he “believed implicitly that this was a work event”, has not received notice of a fine in relation to the gathering. But with the prime minister having already been fined once for attending his own birthday event in June 2020, there is the risk he could be fined further times, with claims that police are looking into another five possible rule-breaking events he is said to have attended. The Met has said it will make no public updates on the number of fines issued until after the local elections. However, Downing Street has stated it will still announce if the prime minister receives further fines in the lead up to polling day. In addition to a police probe and an investigation by senior civil servant Sue Gray, the PM will be subject to a third inquiry by the House of Commons privileges committee about the Partygate scandal. It will seek to determine whether he knew about the alleged rule breaches before making his statements to MPs. An attempt to block this third investigation failed this week, amid a backbench rebellion. Facing questions about the alleged parties during his final day in India on Friday, the prime minister said he would still be in power in the autumn, having set the target of signing a trade deal with New Delhi by October.', 'Sat 23 Apr 2022 12.33 BSTLast modified on Sat 23 Apr 2022 12.54 BST'),

She has been accused of giving that evidence even though she knew about the unpublished clauses in the policy not to use pushbacks against asylum seekers.

Priti Patel must apologise and rethink large sections of her borders bill before it returns to the Lords. It is a disgraceful breach of the rule of law.” Details of the unpublished policy came to light during a legal challenge to the pushbacks plan brought by the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), and the NGOs Care4Calais, Channel Rescue and Freedom From Torture. The Home Office had applied to the high court for public interest immunity to avoid making the details of the pushbacks policy public. This mechanism is used where sensitive issues such as organised crime, terrorism or national security are involved. But judges said disclosure of the policy did not “give rise to a real risk of serious harm to the public interest”. The government has always said the pushbacks policy would only be used when safe to deploy it. Restrictions on usage of the tactic are outlined in the nationality and borders bill which is due to return to the House of Lords on 26 April. However, since the policy was announced last October ministers have not said publicly that it would not be used against asylum seekers. A key part of the unpublished policy disclosed in the high court judgment is that anyone in a dinghy who indicates they wish to claim asylum in the UK should not be pushed back but instead escorted to UK shores. Almost everyone who uses this method to reach the UK is an asylum seeker according to the Home Office’s own data. The ruling reveals the pushback policy states: “Should a migrant request asylum whilst in UK territorial waters they must be returned to the UK for processing.”  According to the high court judgment, a clause in the unpublished policy says “the actual number of migrant vessels successfully intercepted is likely to be extremely low”. It adds that one of the “acceptable outcomes” is that during operational deployments no migrant vessels are assessed as suitable for safe turnaround. Paul O’Connor, the head of bargaining at the PCS, said: “PCS has been pressing the Home Office for transparency in these proceedings. They have gone to considerable lengths to keep certain matters shrouded in secrecy. This judgment has left them nowhere to hide and has exposed their real agenda.” Clare Moseley, the founder of Care4Calais, said: “I’m shocked that this government tried to hide the fact that refugees who request asylum in UK waters have a right to be brought to the UK to process that request.” Toufique Hossain, the director of public law at Duncan Lewis solicitors, who represents PCS and Care4Calais, described the judgment as “deeply concerning”. “In light of the extreme measures that are now being taken and proposed to prevent asylum claims being considered in the UK, there is a greater need than ever for transparency.” In a speech on 14 April about tackling illegal migration, the prime minister said Channel pushbacks were unlikely to be used much although provision for the tactic remained in the immigration bill. “It’s clear that there are extremely limited circumstances when you can safely do this in the English Channel,” Johnson said. A government spokesperson said: “The entire government is united to protect lives, prevent dangerous Channel crossings and break the business model of criminal gangs profiting from these fatal journeys. “It is right to consider all safe and legal options to prevent people making these unnecessary journeys, all of which comply with both domestic and international law.”', 'Sat 23 Apr 2022 10.11 BSTFirst published on Fri 22 Apr 2022 15.05 BST'),

The government closed the “tier 1 investor visa” scheme in February amid the build-up of Russian forces on Ukraine’s border as it prepared to broaden its occupation beyond Crimea, which it annexed in 2014. Since the invasion, sanctions targeted at many of Russia’s richest businessmen have become a key part of the response by the UK and its allies. The measures have also prompted awkward questions for the government, with critics accusing it of offering an open door to kleptocrats and oligarchs, who in some cases are thought to have expropriated wealth from the Russian state on a massive scale. Much of that wealth has been used to buy luxury property in London. The golden visa scheme allowed people with at least £2m in investment funds and a UK bank account to apply for residency rights, along with their family. Before 2018 it is thought that minimal checks were carried out on investors or the source of their wealth. The government revealed that 10 Russians who received golden visas are now subject to sanctions, an increase from the eight previously admitted, in a written answer to a question from Stephen Kinnock, Labour’s shadow immigration minister. Kevin Foster, a junior Home Office minister said seven of those 10 Russian nationals “either obtained an initial grant of leave or obtained further leave via the route after 2014”. The government declined to name the people who received the visas, despite demands from Labour and Spotlight on Corruption, a campaign group. In 2014 David Cameron, then prime minister, said Russia must “choose the path of diplomacy and de-escalation, or face increasing isolation and tighter and tighter sanctions”. However, the latest data suggested that the government continued to wave through visas for Russian nationals now considered by officials to play key roles in supporting Putin’s regime. “Putin’s invasion of Crimea should clearly have been a fork in the road for how the British government viewed Russian oligarch investors,” said Kinnock. “It therefore beggars belief that – even after the threat posed by Putin to western security and British interests had been exposed – the Conservative government continued to award grants of tier 1 (investor) leave to seven of Putin’s cronies who would later be sanctioned.” Spotlight on Corruption said the latest revelation made it even more urgent that the government release a 2018 report on the golden visa scheme. A minister last month committed to publish it, but the government has not yet done so. Susan Hawley, the group’s executive director, said: “This is compelling evidence of the frankly shocking complacency in the UK government about Russian money coming to the UK even after Russia started its aggression against Ukraine in 2014. “The golden visa regime looks increasingly like a state-sponsored scheme to enable kleptocracy. The lessons must be learned for the UK visa regime across the board.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We have made it clear we will not tolerate abuse of our immigration system and we have closed the tier 1 (investor) route with immediate effect to ensure that those who have profited from dirty money cannot gain access to the UK. “We want to make it clear that the UK is no safe haven for those who enable the Putin regime. By implementing the largest and strongest sanctions package in the UK’s history, we are continuing to crack down on these individuals and making sure they pay the price.”', 'Fri 22 Apr 2022 18.27 BSTLast modified on Fri 22 Apr 2022 19.10 BST'),

Insider accounts are rare, but as owners and their crew come under scrutiny like never before after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a captain who has worked for some of the wealthiest boat owners has come forward to share details of his 15 years at sea. His account is of a world that is both showy and shadowy, with weekly food orders worth more than €40,000 (£33,000) flown in from Paris, expensive morning-after clean-ups to remove traces of party drugs, and what he sees as an ingrained culture of prostitution and sexism. The captain, who has sailed throughout the Caribbean and Mediterranean yacht hotspots, said he wanted to highlight how rich owners – and particularly Russians – hide behind a “mess of shell companies” in secrecy jurisdictions such as the Marshall Islands or the Cayman Islands. As western allies have curbed the financial freedoms of oligarchs who surround Vladimir Putin with sanctions, yachts have become key targets. Among those impounded are the 86-metre Amore Vero, which French authorities believe belongs to Igor Sechin, head of the Rosneft oil company, and the 156-metre Dilbar, thought to be owned by metals billionaire Alisher Usmanov (although both have denied ownership). “They’re operated in a super-secretive way so they can use them and deflect attention from the ownership,” said the captain, who asked to remain anonymous because he had signed confidentiality agreements. He said he had not worked on any of the seized yachts.  In some cases non-disclosure agreements are mandatory to even interview for a job, he said. The Guardian was shown examples of actual yacht employment contracts: one contains detailed clauses forever barring the disclosure of any information about the identities of the owner or any guests – specifically including references to business documents, photographs and even drawings of the boat. Posting photographs of the yacht on social media can be a firing offence, and talking to the media is strictly forbidden. Another contract shows employees must consent to polygraph lie detector tests if required. There is good reason, said the captain: normal laws often do not seem to apply on these floating palaces . He said deep cleaning to remove traces of drugs such as cocaine can be a regular requirement, particularly when moving from one European territory to another where customs officials can insist on spot checks. The extent of prostitution is an open secret, he claimed, with women regularly transported to boats. The industry is “very sexist and ageist and racist”. He suggested non-white crew or those from poorer countries have little chance of being hired, and female staff are usually required to send full-length profile photos to prospective employers. Friends and former colleagues working on several other boats have reported that female crew members are forced to test regularly for sexually transmitted diseases. Some specific yacht users are known to regularly exchange sex for gifts such as luxury watches. “It’s the norm in the industry,” the captain said. “The owners want to hook up with the stewardesses. It’s quite crazy, and disgusting.” Yet every summer flocks of young people head to the world’s superyacht hotspots – places such as Antibes, Palma de Mallorca or Fort Lauderdale – to do the “dock walk”: stopping at every big boat along the marina and asking for work. They end up serving the guests or endlessly cleaning salt water from every window. A life of sun, sea and high pay is the reward. Even junior deck hands with little experience pocket €2,500 a month – an attractive salary when room and board are included, and when maritime loopholes mean earnings can be tax free. Senior crew can earn many times that: some of most prized chefs have been known to earn €25,000 a month, while some captains of the biggest yachts – overseeing a staff of as many as 80 – can earn as much as €40,000 a month. “The billionaires, it’s their toy,” the captain said. “The money is just a number to them at the end of the day. They’ll pay crazy amounts just to make it work.” Below Deck, a reality TV show that started in 2013 (and given a second lease of life by internet streaming), depicts an industry of party animals working through constant hangovers, and that does happen on many boats, the captain acknowledged. Yet at the top end that lifestyle is not tolerated. “Below Deck gives everybody a funny spin on how it is,” said the captain. “My crew are calm and do healthy hobbies.” The sanctions on Russian yacht owners mean unprecedented upheaval at the top end of the industry, but there have been only occasional public signs of crew turning against owners – in part because of fear for their careers. “We all do recognise how much of a conflict of interest it is, and it shouldn’t exist,” the captain said. “It’s crazy how it does and it goes unregulated.”', 'Fri 22 Apr 2022 16.40 BSTLast modified on Fri 22 Apr 2022 18.32 BST'),

The wide-ranging Digital Services Act (DSA) can fine a company up to 6% of its global turnover for violating the rules – which would be $7bn (£5.9bn) in the case of Facebook’s owner – while repeated breaches could result in a tech firm being banned from doing business in the EU. The new rules, which come into force in 2024, include:  Banning advertising aimed at children or based on sensitive data such as religion, gender, race and political opinions.  Allowing EU governments to request removal of illegal content, including material that promotes terrorism, child sexual abuse, hate speech and commercial scams.  Forcing social media platforms to allow users to flag illegal content in an “easy and effective way” so that it can be swiftly removed.  Online marketplaces like Amazon will need similar systems for suspect products, such as counterfeit sneakers or unsafe toys. The DSA has been drawn up against a backdrop of political and regulatory action against online platforms around the world. The UK is introducing the online safety bill, which imposes a duty of care on tech firms to shelter users from harmful content, while in the US, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission has filed antitrust actions against Google and Facebook. The agreement in the early hours of Saturday came after more than 16 hours of negotiations between EU member states, the EU’s executive arm and EU parliamentarians. The DSA is the second prong of a plan by the EU antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, to rein in the US tech giants. Last month, she won backing from the 27-country bloc and EU parliament for landmark rules called the Digital Markets Act that could force Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft to change their core business practices in Europe. “We have a deal on the DSA: the Digital Services Act will make sure that what is illegal offline is also seen and dealt with as illegal online – not as a slogan, as reality,” Vestager said in a tweet. The EU’s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, said: “With the DSA, the time of big online platforms behaving like they are too big to care is coming to an end.” Other measures in the DSA will require large online platforms and online search engines to take specific measures during a crisis. Theywere triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the related disinformation. The companies could be forced to hand over data related to their algorithms to regulators and researchers. The companies also face a yearly fee of up to 0.05% of worldwide annual revenue to cover the costs of monitoring their compliance. Flora Rebello Arduini, a director at SumOfUs, which campaigns for corporate accountability, said: “This law is a massive victory for people across Europe who have stood up to demand an end to the era of big tech abuses. It also sends a strong signal to leaders everywhere – citizens will not sit back while unregulated and unrestrained tech corporations play havoc with their communities.” In a statement, Google said: “As the law is finalised and implemented, the details will matter.

Most of the UK’s sunflower oil comes from Ukraine and the war has had a devastating impact on availability as exports ground to a halt. With firms left scrabbling to source other vegetable oils, the price of cooking oil in the shops is about a 20% higher than a year ago. Tesco has introduced a buying limit of three bottles per customer across its entire cooking oil range. The UK’s biggest retailer says it has good availability of cooking oil but on its website a small number of vegetable oils are out of stock. Tesco is following in the footsteps of Morrisons and Waitrose which have already limited purchases to two a person. Waitrose said it was “closely monitoring the situation and working with our suppliers to ensure customers continue to have a choice of cooking oils”. Sainsbury’s and Asda have yet to take any action. As well as being a cupboard staple at home, sunflower oil can also be found in hundreds of products, from ready meals to crisps, and biscuits to mayonnaise. Tom Lock, founder of The British Snack Company, which makes hand-cooked crisps for sale in pubs, said that after potatoes, its other key ingredient was sunflower oil. “Sunflower oil is the industry standard for snacks,” said Lock who explained the company had been forced to switch to rapeseed oil. “It is impossible to get sunflower oil in any quantity. You just can’t get it. We’ve secured enough rapeseed to get us through to August, but we are paying three times as much for it as we were for sunflower oil a year ago.” Lock said it was inevitable that price increases would be passed on to the customer. “We’ve already done one price increase to our customers this year,” he said. As an interim step to make sure foods such as crisps, breaded fish, frozen vegetables and chips remain on sale, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has said suppliers can switch to using rapeseed oil and allow their labels to catch up. Shoppers should look out for stickers on packets and on shelves explaining any recipe change, it advises. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said some retailers had put limits on cooking oil purchases “as a temporary measure to ensure availability for everyone”. Andrea Martinez-Inchausti, deputy director of food, said that where sunflower oil had been substituted retailers would “change product labels as soon as possible”. Gary Lewis, of oil importer KTC Edibles, said that vegetable oil prices had eased off their recent highs but were still “way up” on before the war. Other factors, such as the crop problems linked to Covid and the climate crisis, as well as the competing demand for biofuels, were also underpinning the market, he said. “Prices are still extremely high and that will contribute towards the high inflation around the world.” On Friday, Indonesia, the world’s biggest palm oil producer, announced it would ban exports of cooking oil and its raw materials to reduce domestic shortages and hold down skyrocketing prices. President Joko Widodo announced the ban, a day after hundreds of people protested in the capital against rising food costs.

Michael Murray, the Frasers “head of elevation”, who is engaged to Ashley’s daughter Anna, is being handed a cash payment three times larger than any previous sum he has earned from Sports Direct. It is being made under a controversial agreement in which Murray is paid a consultancy fee based on value generated under property deals made for the company. Murray’s MM Prop Consultancy Ltd is entitled to up to 25% of any value created by its services to Frasers, which also owns the House of Fraser department stores, the designer fashion chain Flannels, the gaming retailer and events group Game, Evans Cycles and Jack Wills. The £20.9m payment handed to Murray for 2022 comes after a £2.5m sum in 2021 and £9.7m in payouts during 2019 and 2020.

Now, Zoom has agreed to a “historic” payout of $85m as part of a class-action settlement brought by its users, including church groups who said they were left traumatized by the disruptions. As part of the settlement agreement, Zoom Video Communications, the company behind the teleconference application that grew popular during the pandemic, will pay the $85m to users in cash compensation and also implement reforms to its business practices. On Thursday, federal judge Laurel Beeler of California granted final approval to the agreement which was first filed in July. The agreement was granted preliminary approval in October. The settlement stems from 14 class-action complaints filed against the San Jose-based company by users between March and May of 2020, in which they argued that the company violated their privacy and security. In one incident two years ago, the Saint Paulus Lutheran Church in San Francisco was hosting a bible study class in which most of the participants were senior citizens. However, shortly into the session, “Zoom allowed a ‘known offender’... to ‘Zoombomb’ the class,” according to a federal lawsuit that was filed in May 2020. According to the lawsuit, participants “had their computer screens hijacked and their control buttons disabled while being forced to watch pornographic video footages”, including images of child sex abuse and physical abuse. The host was unable to remove the hijacker from the meeting room and asked the participants to leave and rejoin the meeting, only for the hijacker to bombard the meeting again with graphic content. The incident left the host and the participants “traumatized and helpless”, said the lawsuit. In another incident that occurred in April 2020, participants who joined the virtual Sunday services at Oakland’s Oak Life Church via Zoom were bombarded with child sex abuse images. According to court documents reviewed by the Los Angeles Times, “The participants from that meeting, many of whom were trauma survivors to begin with, were left traumatized and devastated. “Oak Life Church was required to hire trauma counselors and establish support groups to assist its congregation in dealing with the resulting trauma,” the documents added. In addition to failing to prevent “Zoombombings”, the case’s plaintiffs have accused Zoom of unlawfully sharing data with authorized third parties such as Facebook, Google and LinkedIn and misrepresenting the strength of its end-to-end encryption protocols. Mark Molumphy, one of the attorneys representing Zoom in the case, described the settlement as “groundbreaking” in a statement, adding that it would also “implement privacy practices that, going forward, will help ensure that users are safe and protected” According to Molumphy, paying users who submit claims will be eligible for 30% of the subscription payment they made during the class period and others will each receive approximately $29. There are around 150 million settlement class members, which include paying and non-paying users, and the compensation amounts may change, depending on how many claims are submitted. “In the age of corporate surveillance, this historic settlement recognizes that data is the new oil and compensates consumers for unwittingly providing data in exchange for a ‘free’ service,” plaintiff’s attorney Tina Wolfson said in a statement on Friday. “It also compensates those who paid for a product they did not receive and commits Zoom to changing its corporate behavior to better inform consumers about their privacy choices and provide stronger cybersecurity,” she added. As part of the settlement, Zoom has agreed to over a dozen changes to its business practices that are designed to “improve meeting security, bolster privacy disclosures and safeguard consumer data”, according to court documents. As part of those changes, the company is required to develop and maintain a user-support ticket system to track reports of meeting disruptions, a documented process for communicating with law enforcement regarding disruptions that include illegal content, a suspend-meeting button and the ability to block users from certain countries.', 'Sat 23 Apr 2022 06.00 BSTLast modified on Sat 23 Apr 2022 06.45 BST'),

After taking a weekend trip to a friend’s dacha in the countryside, Dasha posts videos of her friends laughing, making pancakes or playing party games. The atmosphere is warm, the alcohol flowing. The next tile shows Dasha looking solemnly at her phone. “I was constantly watching the news to understand what was going on in the world and one thought wouldn’t escape my mind …” she writes. Next tile: “Maybe I should leave Russia?” in bold red letters. In smaller black text underneath, she elaborates: “At least for a little bit of time, until the situation calms down and we have a better understanding.” There is a question box for followers to answer: “What do you think about this?” Does Dasha’s concern about “world news” extend to criticism of Putin’s war in Ukraine? Not exactly. Later, she clarifies for her followers that what prompted her to consider leaving Russia is the potential hit to her income now that the Russian government is blocking access to Instagram. She also worries that the military situation might mean someone called Denis, whom I take to be her boyfriend, could be conscripted into the army. On her TikTok page she appears to briefly participate in a trend associated with nationalist messaging. In a video featuring the Soviet folk song Katyusha, Dasha writes: “I hope my position is clear” and adds the Russian flag and heart emojis. She later deletes the video. Russia is home to a thriving community of influencers and content creators, who live a life of luxury compared with the average citizen. Among the most popular is Dina Saeva, 22, who has more than 7.6m followers on Instagram and 24.5m on TikTok, where she posts short dance routines to viral songs and sports an ever-changing fashion aesthetic (including dressing as a goth, an e-girl and a Kylie Jenner-esque “Insta baddie”). Like many of her peers, she references designer clothes, travel and her latest ad campaigns. Dina’s friend Rahim Abramov became the country’s highest-paid TikTok creator in 2020. He made his name with comedy skits on Instagram, often with his grandmother, but now his reel features music, fancy cars, custom clothing and sponsored posts. Blogger Nastya Ivleeva, who also grew her platform by posting relatable, humorous videos, is a bit less flashy, though still incredibly wealthy thanks to 18.7m followers on her main Instagram profile, 8m on her “personal” one and 4.4m on YouTube. She hosts popular talkshows there, presents on TV, vlogs about her life and does arty campaigns with brands such as Prada. Until Russia invaded Ukraine, it seemed nothing could get in the way of these young people’s fame. There is a huge audience for their content: 63.7% of Russians aged 16-64 use Instagram, and 46.6% are on TikTok. But as the war spills over into online spaces, the influencer landscape seems to be losing its gloss. For the last month or so, I have been following dozens of these social media accounts to get a deeper insight into the minds of young Russians. I wanted to find out about the influencers’ feelings on the war, the limits to their freedom of speech and how they are reacting to a deluge of sanctions and social media restrictions. How is the pervasive atmosphere of fear, denial and discontent affecting them and their young fanbase? Russia first restricted access to Instagram on 14 March. The government decision followed a confusing week in which it appeared that Meta, the social network’s parent company, was relaxing its hate-speech policies to allow posts condoning violence in response to the invasion of Ukraine. It then clarified that this applied only to posts made in Ukraine. A week earlier, TikTok had suspended livestreaming and the uploading of new content to its service in Russia while it reviewed the safety implications of the country’s new “fake news” law. The legislation can result in up to 15 years in jail for those spreading “false information” about the “special military operation”, as Russia calls the war; or calling for sanctions. Later in March, Russia banned Instagram and Facebook altogether, citing its extremism laws and describing the platforms as “carrying out extremist activities”, cutting off 80m users. When war was officially announced, views among influencers were divided. Instagram food blogger and socialite Veronika Belotserkovskaya became one of the first to be charged for her Instagram posts, which investigators said “contained knowingly false information about the use of the Russian armed forces”. On her feed, she posted vibrant pictures showing the blue and yellow of the Ukrainian flag, and openly mocked propaganda based on Russia’s pro-war Z symbol. Others, including Ivleeva, posted a black square on their feeds with the caption “No to war” or called for peace. TV presenter Ivan Urgant also posted a black square to his 10m Instagram followers, with the caption: “Fear and pain, no to war.” That night, his late-night show on the major state-owned Channel 1 was taken off-air and hasn’t returned. Urgant flew to Israel with his family, later explaining it was “a holiday”. Other influencers carried on posting as before, only briefly mentioning “the situation”. A few, such as Abramov, took a break from posting, only to start again weeks later. Still others openly supported Russia in the war, expressing patriotic sentiments in lengthy captions. Some of the most loyal came from outside the country, with Dubai-based Russian influencers such as Sonia Plotnikova writing: “We will deal with all hardships! ❤ Russia is the strongest country ❤ This whole situation will bring us all together! We have become even bigger patriots.” Although restrictions on western social media platforms have undoubtedly reduced their reach, Russians who know how can still access influencer content by using virtual private network (VPN) services, which create a secure encrypted connection that hides the browser’s location. And the platforms are still being used by pro-Kremlin domestic users to spread misinformation and propaganda. TikTok has been named one of the worst, thanks to its vast user base and minimal filtering of content. The proliferation of accounts in which young people speak to the camera, seemingly parroting pro-Kremlin statements, has led some to wonder if they are being paid to do so. With many identical videos, often word for word, almost like bots, they make for dystopian viewing. These younger influencers, it seems, have become a tool in Putin’s propaganda war, to quash unrest and political discontent. A Vice News investigation revealed something of the workings of this coordinated campaign. A secret channel on the messaging app Telegram reportedly directs influencers on what to say, how to capture videos, which hashtags to use and even what time of day to post content. In one case, content creators were reportedly instructed to use an audio track featuring Putin calling for all ethnic groups in Russia to unite at this time of conflict. The same phrases crop up regularly, such as: “The freeing operation in Ukraine is necessary” and “Children deserve a peaceful sky above them.” A few of these videos have since been deleted. On TikTok, videos under hashtags such as #RussianLivesMatter have hundreds of millions of views. The folk song Katyusha makes regular appearances, with videos of users juxtaposed with images of Putin, Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov or even Jesus, captioned: “Who will help the Russians?” or holding their Russian passports to the camera, with the caption: “I hope my position is clear.” Other posts use the “mirror” TikTok filter: on one side, the user stands under the word “Russia”; on the other, under “Donbas”, the coal-rich region on the border of eastern Ukraine where pro-Russian sentiment is high. The background track is Brother for Brother; influencers beat their chests with their fists, lip-syncing: “We don’t leave our own.” As recently as April, young people could be seen holding signs or showing text on their phones with “Russophobia”, “Donbas”, “Hate Speech”, “Cancelling”, “Luhansk”, “Sanctions”, “Info Wars”, “Nationalism” and “Russian Lives Matter”. The videos, and TikTok dances in which young people use their hands to form a Z sign, are tagged under #RLM. Yevgeny Kuklychev, a senior fact-check editor at Newsweek magazine, who tracks Russian-language misinformation, has seen similar online behaviour in response to internal protests before, specifically in February 2021 after the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was imprisoned. This coordinated campaign extended to Instagram, Facebook and the Russian social network VKontakte. “Last year was the first time we saw that among TikTokers and Telegram channels and influencers,” Kuklychev says, adding that details on their operation were leaked by users who declined to take part. “They shared the online job offers; either someone reached out to them, or they found an ad that offered people small payments – a few dollars per video. Back then the talking points were to denigrate Navalny and his supporters, and the overall message was that people were tired of talking about protests.” Kuklychev says a disordered dispersal of online information has been the predominant strategy used by the state to quell dissent. The idea is to put so much information out there that people are confused into apathy and inaction. Another strategy – “digital astroturfing” – refers to generating pro-Kremlin messaging or events that can be amplified online. One example was the Putin rally For a World Without Nazism, held on 18 March. Viral content was made of protesters, Putin’s speeches and other musical performances. “You’re also seeing the Z sign and schoolchildren being led outside to make that shape – which means organised flash mobs. It’s essentially rallying students or state workers to pseudo organic gatherings,” Kuklychev explains. Though this type of content has outraged those who see it as propaganda, users supportive of the government line will continue to interact with it and share it, no matter how obvious the staging. The aim is to polarise Russia even more – and it’s working.  Masha (not her real name), 25, a teacher from Moscow, says the climate online has made her more conscious of how she behaves: “I archived all my photos on Instagram so no one can place me anywhere. I’ve tried to make my accounts as impersonal as possible.” She says she’s lucky to be surrounded by family and friends who are against the war, but being exposed to so much pro-war propaganda has made her realise she is living in a bubble. “Looking at some of the TikTok videos, I was honestly taken aback: I’ve never come across posts like this in my feeds.” She has been particularly frustrated by influencers escaping Russia and showing their “patriotism” from abroad. “Suddenly it turns out everyone knows someone who has a visa or the necessary documentation to just leave at any moment. It feels incredibly disheartening – maybe I won’t get the chance to travel any more, and it’s rubbing salt in the wound seeing other people do it.” Katya (not her real name), 22 and from St Petersburg, senses the information war is stoking paranoia and anger among the wider population, and tearing people apart. “I have a friend who was never into politics, but recently I opened her Instagram page and saw a post where she says that, now, Russians should be more unified than ever,” she says. Shocked by hashtags at the end of the post saying “We are for peace” and “We don’t abandon our own”, Katya sent it to a mutual friend: “He was, like, this is 100% sponsored, because there are other posts like this one.” While not surprised that influencers and celebrities are engaging in pro-Putin propaganda, Katya didn’t expect to see people she knows doing the same: “One woman published a post where her husband shaved the letter Z on the back of his head. And she put a very patriotic caption underneath.” During the final hours before the Instagram ban, Russian influencers’ reactions flooded my timeline. The loud and charismatic video blogger Karina Lazaryantz laughed about the platform’s closure, posting a last-minute comedy sketch. She pointed out that her university degree might finally come in useful, if she has to get a new job. Fashion blogger Karina Nigay livestreamed her tears while declaring: “Instagram is my life.” Singer and TV presenter Olga Buzova recorded a video in which she, too, cried about losing her audience. Most posted links to their Telegram channels and VKontakte profiles in a bid to transfer their fans. That said, “business as usual” has become a far harder image to sell as international companies cut ties with Russia, brand deals with Prada, Hugo Boss and even Domino’s Pizza disappear, and the reality of sanctions sinks in. In the early days of the war, some influencers – such as Gusein Gasanov, the YouTube star best known for his comedy and “random acts of charity” videos in which he rewards ordinary people for good deeds – were posting guidance on how to use VPNs or what services were “best” on Telegram, in a desperate attempt to keep things as they were. Though clearly gutted to lose their platforms, not a single content creator I came across blamed the government for cutting access to Instagram; perhaps they were too scared to speak out. “It’s depressing. I started my Instagram account 11 years ago and it’s 50% of my income,” says Karina Istomina, a popular DJ and influencer based in Moscow, with more than 400,000 followers. She has been on the cover of Marie Claire Russia, appeared in advertorials for Swarovski crystals and Calvin Klein, and hosts a web series on mental health. Her page is also filled with photos of herself and long captions of self-help advice. Recently these have focused on the concept of “radical acceptance”, but she has also written about burnout and sobriety. “Of course, there are people dying right now and other problems are far more outrageous, but it feels like I have lost my job. I hope we will find a way to monetise our content again after some time,” she says. Nearly a month into the ban, how are Russian influencers coping with the new social media rules? “Some people are in psychotic hysteria and screaming that everything is falling apart; some are just trying to adapt to a new world. My daily routine is the same as it was,” Istomina says. Friends abroad keep texting to ask if there is any food in the shops. “Yes! We have food, sugar, other supplies! But everything has risen in price.” Telegram is by far the most popular app for Russian influencers looking for a new home. It can be used as a messenger app and to create channels where people can post videos, photos, voice notes and polls. Overall, the platform is a lot less visual, making it harder to sell a lifestyle or an aesthetic than on Instagram. Dina Saeva’s 170,000 Telegram followers pale in comparison with the millions of followers on her other accounts. Even Buzova, one of Russia’s biggest media personalities, hasn’t been able to hit 1m on her Telegram channel, despite posting constantly, and temporarily deleting her Instagram account with more than 23m followers. Yet Russian influencers are doing all they can to monetise themselves, pushing song promos, ads for homegrown fashion brands, promoting non-fungible tokens and other people’s channels; some are even posting “get rich quick” schemes on new, less regulated platforms. Saeva is hosting cash competitions on Telegram to grow her audience, while others, such as Lazaryantz, have turned to posting about western pop-culture news, memes and personal videos. No one who wants a future as a mainstream influencer in Russia is explicitly talking about the war, unless it’s to discuss which international brands are leaving or which countries are banning Russian nationals. Given their relative mobility, it’s perhaps no surprise that some influencers have decided to skip the headache of internal social media restrictions and leave Russia altogether. Even Buzova, who since the war has repeatedly played her 2017 song My People Are Always With Me over her Instagram stories, went for a long holiday with her mother in Ras al-Khaimah in the United Arab Emirates. She posted videos of herself at the beach, enjoying camel rides and eating at expensive restaurants to “entertain her followers during a difficult time”. She is back now and has resumed normal output. Initial rumours of martial law, closed borders and military conscription sent hundreds of thousands of people with anti-war views off to catch any available flights out of the country. The Kremlin denounced those who left as traitors. Among them were content creators whose material wouldn’t work in a changing Russia, including Grigoriy Mastrider, who has a talkshow discussing literature, philosophy and art on his YouTube channel, which has 200,000 subscribers. Naturally, these themes veer into politics, and he has been unable to hide his criticism of Putin and the government. “This is not a ‘special operation’ but a real war, in which many people are dying for no reason,” he says in one of his videos. “This war was started by a person we didn’t elect, but it’s a situation we will all have to deal with as a consequence.” From a hotel room in Turkey, Mastrider told his audience some creators are pivoting to target an international base by switching to English or having an English-language mirror account. “Yes, I do have plans to work on English-speaking content, but my main focus will still be on my Russian audience, I won’t abandon my country,” he reassured viewers. Where could the Russian government go next in tightening its grip on social media? Kuklychev thinks there may be more restrictions to come. “We’ve seen the clampdown has been gradual and the tightening of the screws incremental, which has eventually led to a complete lack of freedom. It’s a boiling frog effect.” The government has so far given the “extremist” label only to western social media platforms, not to individuals who use them. But who is to say this won’t change? That would be the worst-case scenario for social media users such as Masha, who hopes loopholes to access social media channels and news outlets via VPN won’t get taken away within Russia, especially as international platforms provide an alternative stream of information about the war in Ukraine and play a major role in keeping alive any form of Russian anti-war movement. Like many young Russians, Masha feels shut off from the rest of the world but is afraid of what a more robust digital curtain could bring. Despite their usefulness for pro-Kremlin propaganda, the internal shutdowns of western social media platforms will undoubtedly affect how mainstream Russian society understands the country’s actions in Ukraine. I ask Istomina why she didn’t leave Moscow. “I don’t have any documents, any international bank accounts, any relatives,” she says. “Nobody is waiting for me anywhere, and I don’t have enough money.” Plus, for her, leaving would be an act of “Russophobia”; she doesn’t want to leave the government, her family, friends or city behind. “I love Moscow. That’s why I stay, because I have support here. I’m not alone.” But she is worried. “I’m against people dying and don’t support bloodshed. I really want everything to be over as soon as possible.” One thing has been clear for the past month: whatever social media restrictions are introduced, Russian influencers will find a way to work around them. Says Istomina: “This is a test of strength for all of us.” ', 'Sat 23 Apr 2022 09.00 BSTLast modified on Sat 23 Apr 2022 09.39 BST'),

The Journal reports that she persuaded the digital edition of the Mail not to run stories revealing that an ex-girlfriend of Kotick had obtained a temporary restraining order against him in 2014. Kotick reportedly said that Sandberg, who he dated for three years until 2019, told the Mail in 2016 that if the article were published, it could damage the outlet’s relationship with Facebook. Sandberg allegedly contacted the Daily Mail in 2016 and 2019 to put a stop to the articles, and both times the stories never ran. According to the Wall Street Journal’s reporting, Meta and Activision employees were involved in Sandberg’s effort to kill the story, as well as outside advisers. Facebook is investigating whether Sandberg violated internal rules, the Journal reported, but a spokesperson denied the allegations. “Sheryl Sandberg never threatened the MailOnline’s business relationship with Facebook in order to influence an editorial decision. This story attempts to make connections that don’t exist,” said Mao-Lin Shen, a Meta spokesperson. Some Facebook executives believe any effort by Sandberg to stop a news article could have been seen as a threat given her powerful role at the company, the Journal reported. Advisers to Sandberg were reportedly worried the news of a restraining order against Kotick could damage the Meta executive’s reputation as a champion for women. Sandberg has positioned herself as an advocate for women in the workplace, writing the 2013 book Lean In, which encourages women “sit at the table” and seek challenges to advance in their careers. In 2014, according to the court documents reviewed by the Journal, Kotick allegedly traveled to the home of an ex-girlfriend uninvited, harassing her after she had broken up with him because of his “bullying and controlling nature”. The incident prompted her to obtain a temporary restraining order, which lasted about three weeks. In a statement, Kotick told the Journal that its reporting was inaccurate, and that he never said Sandberg threatened the Daily Mail. Instead, Kotick said, the Mail chose not to run the story because it was not true. Kotick’s ex-partner who took out the restraining order echoed his statement that the allegations she once made against him were untrue. “I told the Wall Street Journal that what I said 8 years ago about Bobby was false. It is still false. In fact, in 2014, I signed a sworn statement making clear that what I had said about Bobby was untrue” she said in a statement that her attorney provided to the Guardian. Kotick has been heavily criticized in recent months over accusations that he was aware of “many incidents of sexual harassment, sexual assault and gender discrimination at Activision Blizzard”. The company has faced multiple sexual harassment lawsuits and was sued by California over its workplace culture, which a state agency described as “a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women”. A group of shareholders accused Kotick of failing either “to ensure that the executives and managers responsible were terminated or to recognize and address the systematic nature of the company’s hostile workplace culture”. The Activision Blizzard board of directors said in a statement that it has been aware of the incident since 2014, and that Kotick had been “fully transparent” to the board. “The board, through its counsel Skadden Arps, has done a thorough examination of the facts and circumstances of the events, satisfied itself that there was no merit to the allegations, and notes that they concern a personal relationship that has nothing to do with the business of the Company. The board continues to have full confidence in Mr Kotick’s leadership and his ability to run the company,” it said in a statement to the Guardian. The Daily Mail did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the Guardian.', 'Fri 22 Apr 2022 07.25 BSTFirst published on Thu 21 Apr 2022 22.01 BST'),

The 2022 Earth Day Google doodle includes four Gifs created from satellite imagery and photographs from The Ocean Agency that will rotate throughout the day. They show glacial retreat at the peak of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania between December 1986 and 2020 and glacial melt in Sermersooq, Greenland, between December 2000 and 2020. Other images show the result of a coral bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef near Lizard Island in Australia between March 2016 and October 2017 and deforestation of the Harz forests in Elend, Germany, between December 1995 and 2020. Climate counsellor Lesley Hughes, a professor of biology at Macquarie University in Sydney, said the images of coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef are “a very high-impact visual image” that would resonate. “Our major natural icon, that we are stewards of, is a symbol of the impact of climate change on an extraordinarily diverse ecosystem,” Hughes said. “Our physical and biological world is transforming before our eyes and that’s what these images are emphasising and so there’s absolutely no time to waste.” The Great Barrier Reef went through its sixth mass bleaching event in March with aerial surveys showing almost no reefs across a 1,200km stretch escaping the heat – the first known to have occurred during a La Niña year. Hughes said for those elsewhere, the images of glacial ice retreating would be similarly meaningful. In New Zealand, the vast and ancient glaciers are thinning at an alarming rate. The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (Niwa) found that between 1977 to 2014, a third of the permanent snow and ice was lost from the Southern Alps – a dramatic decline that began accelerating rapidly in the last 15 years. More recently the summer of 2017-2018 brought temperatures 3C warmer than average across New Zealand, shrinking some glaciers so much they all but disappeared. Elsewhere artefacts long-entombed in the Italian Alps are being revealed as the ice melts, leading to the discovery of equipment left behind by soldiers camped out on the peaks during the first world war and a 5,300-year-old crime scene when the mummified body of Ötzi was found by hikers. What has been a boon for archaeologists is also a symptom of the catastrophic threat caused by climate change. Forni, one of Italy’s largest valley glaciers, has retreated 800 metres within the past 30 years and 1.2 miles (2km) over the past century. The images contrast with the positive note struck with the animation published for Earth Day 2021, which the company said was designed to “encourage everyone to find one small act they can do to restore our Earth”.  Hughes said the confronting images published in 2022 may be a response to the IPCC26 report and were important for raising awareness. “I think when you’re sitting in a middle-class environment and it’s a nice day and the sun’s come up or has gone down, it’s easy to become complacent about the larger forces at work in our climate system and the impacts those forces have,” Hughes said. “So reminding people that just because it’s a nice day, climate change hasn’t gone away is really important.” Alphabet, the company which operates the Google search engine, claims to have been carbon neutral since 2007 and plans to operate all its data centres entirely on renewable energy by 2030. The company used 15.5 terawatt hours of electricity in 2020, mostly to power its data centres. It also slashed the waste generated from its operations by 40% to 28,864 tonnes but increased its water consumption. Its figures for 2021 have not been made available yet but the company says it has compensated for its emissions by buying enough renewable energy and offsets to cover its consumption.', 'Fri 22 Apr 2022 04.29 BSTLast modified on Fri 22 Apr 2022 04.52 BST'),

On top of that equity, Musk is raising a further $12.5bn for the offer via a margin loan secured against his shares in Tesla, the electric carmaker that he runs as CEO. Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, is leading a group of financial institutions providing $13bn in debt financing. The funding commitments were outlined in a filing on Thursday with the US financial watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission. The document confirmed that the world’s richest man was “exploring whether to commence a tender offer” for the shares in Twitter he does not hold. Musk already owns 9.2% of the social media platform and announced a $54.20-per-share bid last week. A tender offer is viewed as a hostile bid because it bypasses the company’s board, which in a conventional takeover situation would be expected to recommend an offer to shareholders. Instead, Twitter’s board has moved to block Musk from increasing his shareholding without its approval. Last week Twitter launched a so-called poison pill defence against Musk’s bid, aimed at blocking him from building a stake in the business bigger than 15%. The tactic, commonly used by company boards as a bulwark against unwanted approaches, will allow existing investors in Twitter to buy shares at a heavy discount if anyone attempts to buy more than 15% of the company without the board’s backing. This would dilute the shareholding of an unwelcome bidder such as Musk and is a significant block to any non-board-approved bid. However, shareholders who support Musk’s approach could force the board to drop the poison pill gambit. “This will put pressure on the board if a groundswell of shareholders tender their shares and could force removal of poison pill and a sale to Musk,” said Dan Ives, a senior analyst at the US financial firm Wedbush Securities. Musk, who has more than 82 million followers on Twitter and is a prolific user of the platform, hinted at the weekend that he was considering a tender approach.

Many buying the forgeries, which can be used across the European Union (EU), are being redirected from websites such as Instagram and Facebook to the Telegram encrypted messenger where they can be bought discreetly, according to a study by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD). The report also raised concerns that social media algorithms are automatically directing people disillusioned with the French government’s handling of the pandemic towards far-right online spaces. ISD’s research coordinator, Zoé Fourel, who led the study, said that while some Facebook groups dedicated to the sale of fake Covid passes had about 1,000 members, there were Instagram accounts with as many as 17,000 followers. “I think, in terms of platforms, the main issue here is the scale to which this is available and with platforms such as Facebook and Instagram,” she said. “Obviously because they have such a wide audience, they are enabling this content on a larger scale. “For Instagram, one of the most alarming things we observed was that its algorithm is actually recommending accounts that are offering fake sanitary or vaccination services, so if you are a person who is following a couple of accounts with Covid disinformation or anti-vax content, your algorithm will recommend more accounts offering fake passes. “There is a really large issue here with the business model and the design of the platform and how it operates.” France introduced “health passes” during the coronavirus pandemic, which also allowed people to prove their status with a negative lateral flow test, as well as being vaccinated. But the French government last month gave approval for a vaccine pass that excludes unvaccinated people from restaurants, sports arenas and other venues. That has made acquiring a fake pass, which can be used across the EU member states, more desirable for anti-vaxxers, according to ISD. Fourel said: “These passes are valid across the EU, so we can see in, for example, a Telegram group that’s dedicated to European far-right movements and there are people selling fake passes. It really is a transnational issue. “You can be in Italy and sell a fake pass to French people and we have seen people from France being redirected in the comments section to Italian Telegram channels.” ISD is calling for more accountability for social media companies, including Snapchat, Meta – which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp – and Telegram, as well as legislation to protect users. Fourel said the upcoming application of the European Digital Services Act, which aims to tackle the spread of disinformation and illegal content, was “necessary”. She added: “When it comes to platforms, it’s quite clear that there needs to be more proactivity to take measures to counter the spread of this type of content because clearly, this does violate the policies that are upheld by them. “There also needs to be more proactivity on behalf of the French government.” Meta says it prohibits anyone from buying or selling fake, or genuine, medical documents on its platforms, including Covid vaccine certificates. It added that it would remove adverts when identified and disable any accounts, pages or groups that break its rules.

And now an archaeological discovery on a small island in Papua New Guinea has recast the early scope of this settlement, in a finding archaeologists say could explain the migration east three millennia ago. The unearthing of animal bones and tools on Brooker Island, 200km east of mainland Papua New Guinea, suggests that the migration of Lapita people throughout Papua New Guinea was far more extensive than previously thought. The Lapita – a group with east Asian ancestry – are archaeologically recognised as the first people to make landfall on the islands of Remote Oceania, which include Tonga, Samoa and Vanuatu. They are believed to have migrated there from south-east Asia, via the Bismarck archipelago off the north-eastern coast of New Guinea between 3,100 and 3,350 years ago. Lapita-linked groups are known to have introduced pottery, animals such as pigs and chickens, and Austronesian languages to New Guinea, which has been inhabited by Indigenous people for at least 50,000 years. In new research published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution, archaeologists believe they have unearthed the earliest evidence for Lapita-introduced animals and imported obsidian – volcanic glass – in southern New Guinea. The findings are between 3,060 and 3,480 years old, they estimate. Dr Ben Shaw of the Australian National University, the study’s first author, said the discovery was evidence of the “initial interaction between Indigenous populations, who were already in the area, and Lapita migrants”. “There were other changes to social systems on the island at that time which indicate there were changes to way people were living there,” Shaw said. “This is a signature that’s new in archaeology, particularly in this part of New Guinea,” Shaw said. “[Lapita] didn’t stay in this area and efforts were therefore put towards going further eastward, which resulted in the colonisation of uninhabited Pacific islands like Vanuatu and all the way out to Tonga and Samoa.” The researchers argue that the “interaction with Indigenous populations during this time was pivotal in influencing island-hopping strategies that culminated in the initial peopling of Remote Oceania”. “Similarly rapid but later Lapita dispersals through southern New Guinea and perhaps across the Torres Strait Islands and along the east coast of Australia, did not, therefore, occur through a terra incognita but were probably facilitated by earlier frontier interactions with Indigenous populations,” they wrote. The team found evidence on Brooker Island for the introduction of pigs and dogs by Lapita, which was accompanied by concurrent changes in behaviour such as the use of turtle shells to make tools, and the targeted harvesting of marine animals. “The contemporary presence of lithic axe-adze technologies unrelated to those associated with Lapita suggests that Indigenous cultural influences contributed to cultural diversity in the region despite language replacement,” the researchers wrote. Shaw said Austronesian languages, which were introduced by Lapita groups, are spoken on most of the islands of Papua New Guinea. “Although these islands have got a very long history of Indigenous occupation, and what the archaeology tells us is that there’s continued input of cultural influence from those Indigenous populations … there was a complete changeover from the Indigenous languages that would have been spoken there to the ones that are now spoken,” he said.

People later compared the roar of the collapsing mine tip to a low-flying jet aircraft or thunder or a runaway train. At first, sheep, hedges, cattle, a farmhouse with three people inside were smothered. Then the wave reached Pantglas junior school and Pantglas county secondary school, burying the former, which was full of children answering the register. One hundred and forty-four people were killed by the tip slide in Aberfan, 116 of them children, mostly between the ages of seven and 10. In the aftermath, a roadblock was set up to control access to the disaster, but more or less anyone in a uniform or an official-looking car could find a way through. During the morning of 22 October, a green Ford Zephyr nosed its way into the village. At the wheel was John Barker, a 42-year-old psychiatrist at Shelton hospital near Shrewsbury with a keen interest in unusual mental conditions. Barker was tall and broad and dressed in a suit and tie. At the time, he was working on a book about whether it was possible to be frightened to death. In the early news reports from Aberfan, Barker had heard that a boy had escaped from the school unharmed but later died of shock. The psychiatrist had come to investigate, but realised he had arrived too soon. When Barker reached the village, victims were still being dug out. “I soon realised it would have been quite inopportune to make any inquiries about this child,” he wrote afterwards. The devastation reminded Barker of the blitz, when he had been a teenager, growing up in south London, but the loss of life in Aberfan was worse for being so concentrated and the dead so young. “Parents who had lost their children were standing in the street, looking stunned and hopeless and many were still weeping. There was hardly anybody I encountered who had not lost someone.” Voyeurs and outsiders who came to Aberfan without good reason were easy to identify. Policemen who stood around drinking tea were shouted at. Someone threw a tobacco tin at a photographer and broke his camera flash. During the course of the day, a steady drizzle came down, soaking the hundreds of rescuers, muddying the streets, which were already inches deep in muck, and raising fears that the tip could suddenly fall again, causing another calamity. The village was dreadfully tense. But Barker did not get back in his car and drive away. He had long been interested in subjects that struck others as macabre or inexplicable. He was, in every outward sense, an orthodox psychiatrist. He had studied at the University of Cambridge and at St George’s Medical School, in London. But he also chafed at the limits of his field. Barker was a member of Britain’s Society for Psychical Research, which was founded in 1882 to investigate the paranormal, and for some years had been interested in the problem of precognition and people who seemed to know what was going to happen to them before it actually did. Talking to witnesses, he was struck by “several strange and pathetic incidents” connected to the disaster. A school bus, carrying children from Merthyr Vale, had been delayed by fog and reached the site after the tip fell. Their lateness saved their lives. A boy had overslept, apparently for the first time in his life, and was sent hurrying to school by his mother, in tears; he was crushed. Inane, unthinking decisions in the moments before the waste came down – a cup of tea before starting work, looking the wrong way, resting on a wall – spared lives and ended others. Barker was interested in the nature of those decisions and what prompted them. Did people have rational fears or inexplicable knowledge? The dark, unnatural tips above Aberfan had long played on local people’s minds. Bereaved families also spoke of dreams and portents. Weeks after the accident, the mother of an eight-year-old boy named Paul Davies, who died in Pantglas school, found a drawing of massed figures digging in the hillside under the words “The end”, which he had made the night before the slide. In the days after his visit to Aberfan, Barker came up with an idea for an unusual study. Given the singular nature of the disaster and its total penetration of the national consciousness, he decided to gather as many premonitions as possible of the event and to investigate the people who had them. Barker wrote to Peter Fairley, the science editor of London’s Evening Standard newspaper, and asked him to publicise the idea. On 28 October, Fairley carried Barker’s appeal in his World of Science column. “Did anyone have a genuine premonition before the coal tip fell on Aberfan? That is what a senior British psychiatrist would like to know,” Fairley wrote. The article described the kinds of vision that Barker was interested in: “a vivid dream”, “a vivid waking impression”, “telepathy at the time of the disaster (affecting someone miles away)” and “clairvoyance”. Barker received 76 replies to his Aberfan appeal. Two nights before the disaster, a 63-year-old man named J Arthur Taylor, from Stacksteads, a village on the edge of the Lancashire moors, dreamed that he was in Pontypridd, in south Wales. He had not been in the town for many years and he was trying to buy a book. He faced a large machine with buttons. “Now I have never seen a computer. This may have been one; I just don’t know,” Taylor wrote. “Then, all of a sudden, while I was standing by this big machine, I looked up and saw ABERFAN written as if suspended in white lettering against a black background. This seemed to last some minutes. Then I turned and looked the other way and I saw through a window rows of houses and everything seemed derelict and desolate.” Taylor did not recognise the word, even though he had driven past the village countless times, until he heard it on the radio on the day of the disaster. In Plymouth, the evening before the coal slide, Constance Milder had a vision at a spiritualist meeting. Milder, who was 47, told six witnesses that she saw an old schoolhouse, a Welsh miner, and “an avalanche of coal” rushing down a mountain. “At the bottom of this mountain of hurtling coal was a little boy with a long fringe looking absolutely terrified to death. Then for quite a while I ‘saw’ rescue operations taking place. I had an impression that the little boy was left behind and saved. He looked so grief-stricken.” Milder recognised the boy later on the evening news. A man in Kent was convinced for days before the Aberfan accident that there would be a national disaster on the Friday. “It came to me as strongly as might come the thought that you have forgotten that it was your wife’s birthday tomorrow,” wrote RJ Wallington, of Rochester. When he arrived at work on 21 October, he told his secretary: “Today’s the day.” Barker wrote back to the percipients, as he called them, asking for details and witnesses. Of the 60 plausible premonitions, there was evidence that 22 were described before the mine tip began to move. The material convinced Barker that precognition was not unusual among the general population – he speculated that it might be as common as left-handedness. In the weeks before Christmas, Fairley and Barker approached Charles Wintour, the editor of the Evening Standard, to open what they called a Premonitions Bureau. For a year, readers of the newspaper would be invited to send in their dreams and forebodings, which would be collated and then compared with actual happenings around the world. Wintour agreed to the experiment. Fairley devised an 11-point scoring system for the predictions: five points for unusualness, five points for accuracy and one point for timing. The Premonitions Bureau was not the first attempt to capture the visions of the British public. In the late 1920s, JW Dunne, an aircraft designer, wrote a popular book called An Experiment With Time that combined an account of his own precognitive dreams with a discussion of relativity theory and quantum physics. In 1902, Dunne was a young soldier serving in the Boer war when he dreamed of a volcano about to explode on a French colonial island, which would kill 4,000 people. A few weeks later, he got hold of a Daily Telegraph, which reported the loss of 40,000 lives after the eruption of Mont Pelée, on the Caribbean island of Martinique, and read about his dream in print. “I was out by a nought,” Dunne reflected. Premonitions, banal and tremendous, stalked him for years. Dunne’s response was unsentimental. “No one, I imagine, can derive any considerable pleasure from the supposition that he is a freak,” he wrote. By the end of the first world war, Dunne was consoled by advances in quantum mechanics that suggested the old order of time was collapsing. “That, already, was in the melting pot,” he wrote. “Modern science had put it there – and was wondering what to do next.” Dunne’s own theory about how time worked, which he called serialism, was hard to follow, but An Experiment With Time was influential because it encouraged thousands of readers to keep dream diaries and to see if their presentiments materialised. Dunne emphasised that we should pay attention to trivial flashes of the future as well as things that seemed important. He liked to sit in the library of his club, pick up a novel, glance at the name of the protagonist and then jot down thoughts and images that came to him, to see if they predicted the plot. One day, Dunne picked up a book by JC Snaith, a cricketer turned popular author, but nothing came to him except a peculiar image of a plain-black, entirely straight umbrella, standing vertical – its handle resting on the pavement – outside the Piccadilly Hotel. The next day, Dunne found himself on a bus as it approached the hotel and noticed a figure walking along: “It was an old lady, dressed in a freakish, very early-Victorian, black costume, poke bonnet and all. She carried an umbrella in which the handle was merely a plain, thin, unpolished extension of the main stick … She was using this umbrella – closed, of course – as a walking stick, grasping it pilgrim’s staff fashion. But she had it upside down. She was holding it by the ferrule end, and was pounding along towards the hotel with the handle on the pavement.” While Dunne’s work was popular in Britain, 20th-century physics and psychology catalysed similar interest in prophetic dreams elsewhere in Europe. In 1933, a Jewish journalist in Berlin, Charlotte Beradt, began secretly writing down the dreams of German citizens soon after the Nazis came to power. Three days after Hitler was elected chancellor, a factory owner dreamed that it took him half an hour of excruciating effort to raise his arm in salute during a visit by Joseph Goebbels. A 30-year-old woman dreamed that all the street signs in her neighbourhood had been replaced by posters with a list of 20 words that it was now forbidden to say. The list started with “Lord” and ended with “I”. Later, the same woman dreamed that a squad of policemen hauled her out of a performance of The Magic Flute because a thought-reading machine – “it was electric, a maze of wires” – had registered her associating Hitler with the word “devil”, when it was sung by Papageno and Monostatos during the opera. Beradt collected around 300 dreams. Many involved bureaucratic absurdity – The Decree of the Seventeenth of this Month on the Abolition of Walls; A Regulation Prohibiting Residual Bourgeois Tendencies – which prefigured the totalitarian intentions of the regime. A Jewish lawyer dreamed that he was crossing Lapland to reach “the last country on Earth where Jews are still tolerated”, but a smiling border official threw his passport into the snow. A green, safe land lay tantalisingly out of reach. It was still 1935. Beradt posted her notes to friends or hid them in books, and published them after the war. In The Third Reich of Dreams, she wrote that these “diaries of the night” seemed “to record seismographically the slightest effects of political events on the psyche”. They were raw, untouched by hindsight and possibly prophetic for that reason. “Dream imagery might thus help to describe the structure of a reality that was just on the verge of becoming a nightmare,” Beradt wrote. In 1940, when Britain was threatened with invasion, the playwright JB Priestley delivered regular Sunday evening radio talks on the BBC, called Postscripts, which were heard by a third of the British population. Priestley was from Bradford. He evinced a patriotic longing from the scattered notes of birdsong or a day trip to the seaside. He was also a follower of Dunne; Priestley described himself as “time-haunted”. In the early 1930s, the playwright had travelled to the American west. Early one morning, he stood by a railing on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon, with the landscape shrouded in mist. Suddenly the mist lifted, the colours shone, and Priestley recognised the railing, the sky and the canyon from a vivid dream that he remembered from years before. (In the dream, he had been sitting in a theatre when the curtain lifted and displayed precisely the same scene.) Priestley’s plays, such as Time and the Conways and, later, An Inspector Calls, reflected his preoccupation with the order of time. He helped to publicise Jung’s idea of synchronicity, which proposed that events could be linked by meaning rather than causation, in the English-speaking world. In March 1963, a few months before Barker arrived at Shelton, Priestley appeared on the BBC arts programme Monitor to talk about time. Priestley was almost 70 years old and had become a beloved national figure. He equated a strict, materialist reading of how time passes – each second of our lives flowing remorselessly, one after the other, until death – with the intellectual barrenness of capitalist consumption. “The moment does not matter because it is only another little step towards final oblivion,” Priestley wrote in Man and Time, which was published the following year. “It is all a tale told by an idiot.” Priestley was struck by how earlier and non-western cultures were comfortable with more sophisticated notions of time. He proposed a model of three concurrent times (the present, the unconscious and a collective unconscious), which was a fusion of Jungian and psychical ideas, not unlike Barker’s. Priestley compared living within the modern understanding of time to balancing on a rope that was fraying at both ends: scientists knew that time was unpredictable at both the planetary scale, because of relativity, and the subatomic scale, because of quantum physics. So why should it flow steadily, ceaselessly, through human lives? Priestley described “a world dominated by the worst idea of time men have ever had”. Man and Time was part confessional, part manifesto. Priestley implored society to step off the “inexorable conveyor-belt to nothingness”. During his BBC broadcast in 1963, the interviewer, Huw Wheldon, invited viewers to send in their own unusual experiences of time. Priestley received around 1,500 letters, of which around a third appeared to come from followers of Dunne. Barker wanted the bureau to be more than another collection of anecdotes. The Aberfan material had convinced him that it was no longer necessary to prove the existence of precognition. In an article for the Medical News in January 1967, two weeks into the experiment, Barker claimed that there were now more than 10,000 incidents recorded in parapsychology journals. “We should instead set about trying to harness and utilise it with a view to preventing further disasters,” he wrote. Like Beradt in Nazi Germany, Barker used the language of seismology to describe mental processes that might be operating at a deep level within the collective subconscious. He wanted an instrument that was sensitive enough to capture intimations that were otherwise impossible to detect. He envisaged the fully fledged Premonitions Bureau as a “central clearing house to which the public could always write or telephone should they experience any premonitions, particularly those which they felt were related to future catastrophes”. Over time, the Premonitions Bureau would become a databank for the nation’s dreams and visions – “mass premonitions”, Barker later called them – and issue alerts based on the visions it received. “Ideally the system would need to be linked with a computer, to help exclude trivial, misleading or false information … With practice, it should be possible to detect patterns or peaks which might even suggest the nature and possible date, time and place of a disaster so that an official early warning could then be issued. “There might be numerous false alarms, particularly in the early stages, when the operators were inexperienced,” Barker conceded. He recognised that the bureau also faced a version of the quandary that haunted Jonah in the Old Testament. God asked Jonah to prophesy the destruction of Nineveh. But Jonah reasoned that if the people of Nineveh believed his warning and repented, God would forgive them and Nineveh would not be destroyed after all. Jonah’s prophecy would turn out to be false, and he would look like a fool. Befuddled and ashamed, Jonah ran away and ended up inside a whale. If a calamity is averted, how can it generate a vision to precede it? “Theoretically, there might be no premonitions since no disaster would have occurred,” Barker acknowledged. But it was worth a shot. There were plenty of cases of premonitions that appeared to have helped avoid certain disasters in the past. “If only one major catastrophe could be shown to have been prevented by this means,” Barker wrote in a paper for the Society for Psychical Research later that year, “the project would have more than justified itself, perhaps for all time.” The bureau got its first major hit in the spring of 1967. At 6am on 21 March, the phone rang in the dining room at Barnfield, Barker’s home in the village of Yockleton, outside Shrewsbury. He went downstairs and answered. It was Alan Hencher, a post office switchboard operator, one of the Aberfan seers who claimed to experience physical sensations before a disaster. “I was hoping not to have to ring you,” Hencher said. “But now I feel I must.” Hencher was coming off a night shift and was calling to predict a plane crash. Barker made notes on a piece of Shelton hospital letterhead. Hencher was upset. He had a vision of a Caravelle, a French-built passenger jet, experiencing problems soon after takeoff. “It is coming over mountains. It is going to radio it is in trouble. Then it will cut out – nothing.” Hencher said there would be 123 or 124 people on board (“? say 124”, Barker jotted down) and that only one person would survive, “in a very poor condition”. Hencher couldn’t tell where the crash was going to happen but he had had the feeling for the last two or three days. It was as if someone on the aircraft was trying to communicate with him. They were trying to make peace. “While I am talking to you, I have a vision of Christ,” Hencher told Barker. He could see a pair of statues and was directed to the crash by a light flashing on and off. Barker’s notes ran to the bottom of the page and into the corner. On the other side of the paper, he noted that he called Hencher back later for more details, but there were none. It was an hour before dawn, on a Tuesday morning. After being woken by Hencher’s telephone call that night, Barker passed the prediction on to the Evening Standard. On 11 April, he and Fairley appeared on Late Night Line-Up, a chatshow on BBC Two, to publicise the bureau. Nine days later, a turboprop Britannia passenger aircraft carrying 130 people attempted to land in Nicosia, Cyprus, during a thunderstorm. The plane, which belonged to Globe Air, a new low-cost Swiss charter airline, was on its way from Bangkok to Basel, carrying mostly Swiss and German holidaymakers. It had refuelled in India and was on route to its penultimate stop, in Cairo, when the pilots were advised the airport was closed because of heavy rain. The flight plan suggested Beirut as the back-up option but the captain, a British pilot named Michael Muller, decided to make an unscheduled landing in Cyprus, despite the bad weather. By the time the plane reached the island, it had been in the air for almost 10 hours. Muller and his co-pilot were almost three hours over their time limits at the controls. At 11.10pm, the aircraft was cleared to land at Nicosia, but came in a little high. Muller requested permission to make a low circuit of the airport and try again. The control tower glimpsed the plane, its landing lights flashing through the low cloud, before it wheeled to the south and clipped a wing on the side of a hill – 22 feet from the summit – rolled over, broke into pieces and caught fire. “124 DIE IN AIRLINER” the Evening Standard reported on its front page the following morning. (The final death toll was 126; two people who survived the initial impact were taken to a nearby UN field hospital, where they died.) At the time, the Nicosia crash was the sixth worst aviation accident in history. Fairley and Barker noticed the similarities with Hencher’s prediction immediately. The Evening Standard published an account of Hencher’s premonition alongside the news coverage that day. “The Incredible Story of the Man Who Dreamed Disaster” the headline read. An accompanying photograph showed Archbishop Makarios, the island’s Greek Cypriot president, picking through the wreckage. Hencher was a gaunt 44-year-old man who lived with his parents in a council house in Dagenham, in Essex, now part of London. The family had moved out of the East End of London before the war. Percy, Alan’s father, had worked as a local government clerk. His mother, Rosina, stayed at home to look after the couple’s three sons. The eldest, Eric, had served in the commandos in Burma; the youngest, Ken, was a professional footballer for Millwall FC in the 50s before leaving the sport to become a customs and excise official. Alan, who had once been an apprentice to an optician, was the odd boy out. The Hencher family liked a drink; Alan preferred to read. He was affable but serious. He was proud of his collection of history books. In 1949, when he was 26, he suffered a head injury in a car accident and was unconscious for four days. His precognitive ability began soon after. “He was just different to the rest of them,” his niece, Lynne, recalled. “He was very intense about everything.” On the day of the plane crash, Fairley tried to call Hencher from the Evening Standard but failed to get through. Barker had arranged to speak to Hencher the following day. Shortly before 1am, the telephone in the dining room at Barnfield rang again. Barker came downstairs. It was the night-time switchboard operator at Shelton. Hencher had called the hospital, trying to reach Barker. He sounded agitated and the operator wanted to put him through. The future of the Premonitions Bureau – and Barker himself – changed direction when Hencher came on the line. As the psychiatrist wrote in an anguished memo the following day: “I suppose anybody who plays about with precognition in this way to some extent sticks his neck out and must accept what he gets.” In the darkness of the dining room, Hencher told Barker that he was concerned for his safety. He had been worried about him all day – that there might be some kind of accident. When Hencher thought of Barker, his mind filled with something black. He urged the psychiatrist to check his gas supply. But Barnfield didn’t have a gas supply. “Have you a dark car?” Hencher asked. Barker’s Zephyr was dark green. “Be very careful,” Hencher warned. “Look after yourself.” Barker asked Hencher if he was telling him that his life was now in danger. “Yes,” the seer replied.

The call for evidence, launched on Saturday, could lead to the medicine Aquiette being reclassified so that it can be bought at a pharmacy without a prescription. One in six women in the UK are thought to have symptoms associated with overactive bladder, such as the sudden, uncontrolled need to urinate which can lead to accidental leaks. Aquiette tablets are used to treat women with milder symptoms of the condition which cannot be controlled by bladder training alone. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is calling on people with the condition, as well as healthcare professionals with experience of treating it, to share their views in the reclassification consultation. Dr Laura Squire, chief healthcare quality and access officer at the MHRA, said: “For many women, an overactive bladder can make day-to-day living extremely challenging. It can impact on relationships, on work, on social life, and it can lead to anxiety and depression. “Fortunately there are treatments around, and from today you will have a chance to have your say on whether one of those treatments, Aquiette, can be available for the first time without a prescription.” The minister for women’s health, Maria Caulfield, said: “When it comes to sensitive issues such as bladder control, speaking to a GP may act as a barrier for some women to seek help. “Reclassification of Aquiette would enable women to access vital medication without needing a prescription.” The Commission on Human Medicines has advised that it is safe for Aquiette to be made available over the counter at UK pharmacies.

An international team of researchers warn that a dramatic rise in the number of satellites is polluting the night sky for astronomers and stargazers, while increasing the risk of objects colliding in space and potentially even striking people or aircraft when they fall back to Earth. Much of the concern is driven by the surge in mega-constellations, which involve placing tens of thousands of satellites in low Earth orbit to deliver broadband internet and other services. While companies such as SpaceX and OneWeb are leading the way, others are interested, including Rwanda, which recently filed an application to launch 327,000 satellites in a single project. Writing in Nature Astronomy, scientists from the UK, US, Canada and the Netherlands warn the number of satellites in low Earth orbit could exceed 100,000 by 2030, disrupting the work of astronomers and reshaping our view of the heavens as the number of satellites seen as “fake stars” starts to rival the number of real stars seen with the naked eye. “We really need to get our act together. We need to see where have we got regulations that we’re not applying properly, and where do we need new regulations?” said the lead author, Andy Lawrence, a regius professor of astronomy at the University of Edinburgh. “This is about recognising that the problems we see in orbit are the same as those we see when we worry about the land, the oceans and the atmosphere. We need to knock heads together and say how can we solve this problem.” Among the proposals are regulations based on a satellite’s space traffic footprint and limits on the carrying capacity of different orbits. In late 2018, about 2,000 active satellites circled Earth. That number has nearly doubled in the past two years with SpaceX launches alone. All have gone into the most congested low Earth orbit, which reaches from 100-2,000km above Earth. In 2019, the European Space Agency moved its orbiting Aeolus observatory to avoid colliding with a SpaceX satellite, the first time it had swerved around an active satellite. Last year, the Chinese moved their space station twice because of similar concerns. The scientists argue that while there is robust regulation to ensure satellites are launched safely and transmit signals only within certain frequency bands, there is almost nothing to govern the impact of satellites on the night sky, astronomy, Earth’s atmosphere or the orbital environment. The researchers describe how light reflecting off satellites can ruin astronomical observations by leaving streaks across images, while their broadcasts can drown out the faint, natural radio signals that astronomers study to understand some of the most exotic objects in the cosmos. But the visible presence of so many satellites also undermines the ability to enjoy the night sky, they argue, an act the International Astronomical Union asserts should be a fundamental right. There are other concerns too. The risk of falling satellite debris causing damage to property or harm to life today is relatively low. But the danger will notch upwards as more satellites re-enter Earth’s atmosphere at the end of their lives, with potentially lethal consequences. “The first aircraft strike or ground casualty is only a matter of time,” the researchers warn. Yet another issue is rocket launch emissions which include carbon dioxide, nitric oxide and soot. “The problem of increasing debris and congestion in Earth orbit poses a real challenge for the governance of human space activity,” said Chris Newman, a professor of space law and policy at the University of Northumbria. “The breadth of new actors and increased geopolitical tensions mean that a binding international treaty is a long way off. In any event, the law can only take us so far. Countries and companies that are active in space need to demonstrate responsible leadership.”', 'Fri 22 Apr 2022 16.00 BSTLast modified on Fri 22 Apr 2022 19.32 BST'),

Researchers say that for the first time it is possible to detect patterns – called mutational signatures – in the DNA of cancers. These provide clues including about whether a patient has had past exposure to environmental causes of cancer such as smoking or UV light, for example. This is important as these signatures allow doctors to look at each patient’s tumour and match it to specific treatments and medications. However, these patterns can be detected only through analysis of the vast amounts of data unearthed by whole genome sequencing – identifying the genetic makeup of a cell. The principal author of the study, Serena Nik-Zainal, is a professor of genomic medicine and bioinformatics at the University of Cambridge and an honorary consultant in clinical genetics at Cambridge University hospitals. She said: “It’s like looking at a very busy beach with thousands of footprints in the sand. To the untrained eye, the footprints appear to be random and meaningless. “But if you are able to study them closely, you can learn a lot about what’s been going on, distinguish between animal and human prints, whether it’s an adult or child, what direction they’re travelling in, etc. “It’s the same thing with the mutational signatures.  The use of whole genome sequencing can identify which ‘footprints’ are relevant/important and reveal what’s happened through the development of the cancer.” Researchers analysed the complete genetic makeup or whole genome sequences (WGS) of more than 12,000 NHS cancer patients. They were able to spot 58 new mutational signatures, suggesting that there are additional causes of cancer that are not yet fully understood. Nik-Zainal said: “The reason it is important to identify mutational signatures is because they are like fingerprints at a crime scene – they help to pinpoint cancer culprits. “Some mutational signatures have clinical or treatment implications – they can highlight abnormalities that may be targeted with specific drugs or may indicate a potential ‘achilles heel’ in individual cancers.” Dr Andrea Degasperi, research associate at the University of Cambridge and first author, said: “Whole genome sequencing gives us a total picture of all the mutations that have contributed to each person’s cancer. “With thousands of mutations per cancer, we have unprecedented power to look for commonalities and differences across NHS patients, and in doing so we uncovered 58 new mutational signatures and broadened our knowledge of cancer.” The findings are being incorporated into the NHS as researchers and clinicians now have the use of a digital tool called FitMS that will help them identify the mutational signature and potentially inform cancer management more effectively. This research was supported by Cancer Research UK and published in the journal Science. The genomic data was provided by the 100,000 Genomes Project, an England-wide clinical research programme to sequence 100,000 whole genomes from about 85,000 patients affected by rare disease or cancer. Michelle Mitchell, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said: “This study shows how powerful whole genome sequencing tests can be in giving clues into how the cancer may have developed, how it will behave and what treatment options would work best.” Prof Matthew Brown, the chief scientific officer of Genomics England, said: “Mutational signatures are an example of using the full potential of WGS. “We hope to use the mutational clues seen in this study and apply them back into our patient population, with the ultimate aim of improving diagnosis and management of cancer patients.”', 'Fri 22 Apr 2022 07.42 BSTLast modified on Sat 23 Apr 2022 05.09 BST'),

India’s official number of deaths from Covid is 520,000. But according to in-depth analysis and investigations into the data by WHO, the total is more than 4 million, which would be by far the highest country death toll in the world. The figure tallies with previous estimates made by scientists, data analysts and medical journals that the true number of deaths from Covid in India was up to 10 times higher than that recorded in official statistics. After the country was engulfed in a devastating second wave in April 2021, central and state governments were accused of covering up the real numbers of those died from the virus in order to deflect accusations that not enough was done to prevent its spread or provide adequate healthcare, medicine and oxygen. According to reports, the WHO had wanted to release the data in January but have received considerable pushback from the Indian government, which have refused to accept the figure and methodology as correct. The WHO has stated it now intend to publish this month the revised data, which estimates 15 million people have died from Covid, more than double the 6 million known deaths. The updated figure, which is drawn from excess death data among other figures, also includes those who died from other illnesses but could not be treated because of Covid. Addressing a New York Times report in which the accusation was made, the Indian government said it was in discussion with the WHO. “India’s basic objection has not been with the result (whatever they might have been) but rather the methodology adopted for the same,” it said in an statement, which alleged the mathematical modelling was “questionable” and “statistically unproven”. However, Jon Wakefield, a professor of statistics and biostatistics at the University of Washington who was one of those involved in the modelling for the WHO, released a statement that explained the methodology in detail and rebutted the claims made by the Indian government about the veracity of the modelling.

(692, 'https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/19/surfs-up-how-to-care-for-wetsuits-and-steamers', 8, 'guardian', '  Surf’s up: how to care for wetsuits and steamers ', 'The late editor Diana Vreeland announced she was envious of surfers during a television interview in the 1970s. “To be a surfer” she said, “between the sky and the water would be, to me, the most wonderful thing”. It’s a sentiment I share, despite finding surfing cold, hard and kind of tedious. The first time I tried it, I mistook a dolphin for a shark and my enthusiasm for it never really recovered. But (like Vreeland) I love the water, and anything that allows me to spend more time in it – like wetsuits. Treated correctly, a good one can last for a decade or more. This week, experts share their advice for protecting the garments that protect you. Lesley Hillyer, owner of Aquasea Underwater Products, sees a lot of broken zips. She says people will often put their wetsuit “halfway on and expect the zipper to finish the job”. She points out that zippers are made of plastic, and cannot handle this kind of repeated strain. While it’s easy enough to repair a broken zip, a bit of extra care slipping into a wetsuit can save you time and money. She advises putting a plastic bag over your foot before you step into each wetsuit leg, as this will make it easier to pull on. If your suit has especially narrow ankles and you’re finding it difficult to take on and off, she suggests getting a professional to cut a wave pattern along the ankle opening, which will increase the surface area and make it easier to take on and off. After spending hours in the water, getting out of a wetsuit feels pretty good. But no matter how desperate you are to get warm and dry, be mindful of where you’re standing when you go to strip off. Hub Hubbard, a wetsuit product developer at Patagonia cautions against undressing on hard or rough surfaces. He suggests laying down a towel or standing in a large bucket to prevent anything abrasive from damaging your suit. Then be sure to rinse your wetsuit thoroughly with fresh water, inside and out. It’s really important to get all the salt out because it can damage your suit over time and, in the short term, a salty suit will take longer to dry. Hillyer says standing under the shower to rinse your suit is not sufficient to remove the salt. Instead, you should submerge it in a tub of water and slosh it around. Every so often, your wetsuit should be washed with a mild non-detergent soap, Hubbard says. Be sure to do this by hand and not in the washing machine, as the machine’s agitator can cause damage. Similarly, putting a wetsuit in a tumble dryer can weaken the fibres. Instead, dry your suit by hanging it in the shade out of direct sunlight, as sun ages neoprene. When you hang your suit, do so by the waist. Hillyer sees a lot of damage in the shoulders of wetsuits that have been hung on coat hangers to dry. She says this is because when the suits are wet, they are very heavy and this puts stress on the shoulders. Instead, she suggests purchasing a piece of plastic pipe from a hardware store, cutting a slit along the length of it and sliding it over your washing line. Then you can fold your wetsuit over the pipe, by the waist. When one side is dry, flip it over, so you get an even dry on both sides. If it’s raining and you need to hang the suit inside, make sure it is in a well-ventilated area to avoid mould. Hubbard says, “I keep all of mine in the garage on a hanger”. When shopping for a wetsuit it’s important to look for one that will function well for your age and build. Hillyer says suits with chest zips are “fantastic if you’re a 16-year-old boy with no shoulders, but if you’re older and less flexible, the chances of breaking the zip as you put the suit on are much higher.” If you’re trying on a suit with a back zip, make sure it is long enough in the body. If the neck of your suit feels like it’s choking you, that is because the suit is too short in back, she says. Equally, it is important your knee is sitting in the middle of the suit’s kneecap. Otherwise, your knee will put pressure on the seams above or below it, and can cause the suit to tear. If your wetsuit tears or the zip breaks, Hubbard says to get it repaired promptly so the damage doesn’t get worse. This is particularly important if a seam unravels, Hillyer says, because “the only thing holding your suit together is glue line and the seam”. If you notice a loose thread, knot it off and take it to get it fixed. “If you wait too long, the glue line will give up and your suit will tear”.', 'Mon 18 Apr 2022 18.30 BSTLast modified on Tue 19 Apr 2022 00.01 BST');

This is my favourite time to write. Banging away at my keyboard in the almost-morning when Mark is asleep in the other room and the city is yet to stir. When I have only the wind for company. I can’t see the wind but I know it is there. I can see how it plays. How it whistles through the seal of my balcony window, turning the wooden blinds into a vertical xylophone, how it quivers through the winter seedlings I’ve just planted in a row of pots, or how it skates across the moonshine mirrored on Sydney Harbour. It must be fun to be the wind, to dip and dive and rumble and roar or just disappear quietly without a whisper. I’ve been watching the wind more closely these past few months. Of all the forces of nature, it’s the most elusive, always in hiding, only its actions giving away its presence. I want to harness those powers. Which is why I’m planning to do something I haven’t done since I was 10 years old. I’m going to fly a kite. And I’m going to do it with Michael Richards, who knows a thing or two about kites – and the wind. Michael and I are meeting outside the art gallery in the Domain. The lawns are buzzing with crowds arriving to see the finalists of this year’s Archibald Prize for portraiture. At this time of year, I would normally be with them, in the dim light, doing a crab shuffle from portrait to portrait, intently examining the walls of famous faces. Yet these days, indoors holds so little appeal. I want to shout to the throng: Hey! Hang out with me instead! I have a date with the wind! My re-enchantment with nature has rekindled my inner child. I can’t wait to scamper through the grass, under the sun, squinting into the wide blue sky, tethered to a long-tailed comet. I can feel the joy rising just thinking about it. Michael arrives carrying a long canvas bag big enough to fit a canoe. What’s he got in there? A kite that size could take us to the moon. With his gentle weathered features under his battered hat and his khaki attire, Michael could have walked out of a verse of Waltzing Matilda. People often use the phrase He walks with a spring in his step – well, Michael is one of those people who truly does. Michael has been teaching people to fly kites for 30 years. In fact, seven years ago Michael and a group of his mates broke the world record for the highest-altitude kite flight. Their base camp was an isolated sheep station in outback New South Wales so they wouldn’t disrupt flight paths. Their determination was impressive: after 40 attempts over 10 years they finally cracked it, sending their kite an extraordinary 5km into the Earth’s atmosphere. Five kilometres! I’ll be happy just to get my kite off the ground. I feel a flutter of performance anxiety. The Domain will make a perfect launch pad for my maiden lift-off – a large field of open grass, trees far away on the fence line, with no powerlines or obstructions. I’m concerned there’s only a kiss of a breeze, but Michael assures me the wind will appear when we need it. It blows differently this time of the year, here, near the Royal Botanic Garden. It tends to come off the water and change direction quickly. I’ll have to keep my wits about me. Michael unzips his bag of assorted contraptions and pulls out a packet. It contains the kit for the first kite I’m going to flight-test. It’s a design similar to the ones from my childhood – a diamond shape with a long tail. It has a texture like paper but Michael explains it’s made from Tyvek – a polyethylene fabric that’s lightweight, durable and waterproof. I tape down the two fibreglass rods in a cross on the back and then thread through some string attached to a spindle. The final touch – tying two long, blue and red shimmering ribbons to its bottom point that will act as a tail, giving the kite drag and balance. My flying machine is ready. We stride out into the middle of the field, following in the footsteps of all the great aviators who have gone before us. Michael holds up my kite and asks me to walk a few metres to the west away from him and then to give a tug on the string. The breeze is much stronger here surprisingly. Little gusts are swirling around my head, tossing my fringe in my eyes. I follow Michael’s instructions and watch as my kite gently lifts into the air as if powered by magic. It hovers there for a bit until I release more string, and then it’s like taking a dog for a walk in the sky. The kite yanks at its tether, demanding more slack as it veers left then right, climbing higher and higher. I start giggling inexplicably as sunlight bounces off the trail of shiny ribbons. Something as simple as watching this little kite dart and loop in the breeze is filling me with a giddy delight. It’s as though the kite is an extension of my body and my hand can touch the sky. It’s as close as I can get to being airborne myself. Michael is enjoying my reaction. It’s why he likes teaching so much. And the teachers in his school groups get just as affected as the kids. Increasingly Michael is being asked to use kite flying to help students better engage with science and nature. He sees kids who struggle in the classroom come out of their shell during a kite session. They relish being freed from their four-walled enclosures and engaging in a battle of wits with the wind. The enchantment of a kite is that it pulls you into a new focus. It takes you to the periphery of your ordinary attention, as biologist EO Wilson so perfectly describes it. There is no room in your head for worry or anxiety or rumination. You’re completely engrossed in the moment and the pressing task at hand – keeping your kite airborne. At times it can require the utmost concentration, tugging at the string when the wind dips, releasing more slack as it picks up again, scooting a few steps here and then doubling back just as quickly. And then, in the next instant, nothing much is required from you at all other than just holding on and letting the current you’ve captured do all the work. Flying kites is all about finding the right balance. It’s the art of knowing when to hold on and when to let go. To be a successful kite flyer is to be in a waltz with the wind, you and your dance partner drawing on each other’s strength, supporting one moment and then allowing yourself to be carried the next.  I’m not very good at allowing others to carry me. Too accustomed to being the big sister, the school prefect. As I flew my kites, I could see how I held the string too tightly, not letting the wind do some of the work. You’re always going to lose if you try to fight the wind. Surrender yourself to its currents and, like a kite, it will propel you forward.

(694, 'https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/16/after-my-sister-died-i-didnt-know-what-to-do-wt', 8, 'guardian', '  After my sister died I didn’t know what to do with my furious pain – but poets and horses led the ', 'This April, I will be older than my elder sister Nell. She died of cancer in December 2019. She was 46 when she died, two years older than me. This year I will be 47. Nell will always be 46. Writing “Nell died” still disturbs me as it did in the months after her death. She was my older sister. She wasn’t supposed to die. As little girls we learned to talk lying in beds beside one another. We sat in the same bath water, shared the same toothbrush, wore the same knickers, fought over the same toys. Her prognosis had been good. Days before her death, we were told she had years – maybe as many as 10 of them – to live. I didn’t think about death; I didn’t want to let it jinx anything by letting its shape enter my consciousness. Ten days later, I was in a hospital room with Nell and our father when a consultant knelt by her bed and told her she had a day to live. I wanted to tell death to stop, to block it from entering the room, to scream at death that I wasn’t ready for it to take her from me. But death when it comes, is unstoppable. So I stood by her bed with her as death came into the room and did its thing. I was undone. My bright world turned dark with a physical, emotional, spiritual pain that overtook it. I felt ripped open and often all I wanted to do was lie on the floor and scream. I have five children so I knew I wouldn’t take my own life, but I fantasised about vanishing into the place I’d come from, before I was born, and finding my sister there. “How are you?” kind friends said, and I didn’t know how to tell them the truth, which was heartbroken, demented, bereft, insane and very, very angry, so instead I said fine, I’m fine, and they would reply they could not imagine what I was going through. I felt alone, quickly learning that society really doesn’t want heartbroken, demented, bereft, insane and very, very angry people walking around, although believe me, there are many of us, all around you, since the people we love are dying all the time. Language, I realised, was failing me every time I tried to speak, so instead I started to write about how I felt inside, a record of how I navigated that first year, which became The Red of My Blood. I didn’t know how to manifest this furious pain in my life, but I wanted to record the otherness of it. I rang a bereavement support group and they pointed me in the direction of some downloadable leaflets. I didn’t want to download anything. I wanted to bury myself alive with a golden chariot or send a flaming ship out into the middle of an ocean. I needed actions that matched the enormity of my feelings, because there was a cathedral collapsing inside my soul every day, and I wanted to know how to express it. This thing that felt like the failure of language made me also think about what we reach for to find comfort or bravery, and where we go when life is frightening. The thing I turn to is horses, which have played a huge role in mine and Nell’s lives. We grew up with scruffy ponies in muddy fields deep in the Wiltshire countryside. When we were teenagers, our mother had a terrible riding accident that left her acutely brain damaged, but if anything this bound Nell and me even closer to horses. They represented a kind of resilience and melancholy bound together which we have both turned to all our lives. So in the weeks after Nell’s death, the place I could make sense of myself was alone outside, on my horse. I could be brave there, almost heroic. I could scream and cry, and my horse wouldn’t judge my snotty face and weird voice. I could terrify myself, too, and that made my heart race, and helped me feel alive. The other place I found solace was in poetry. In Gilgamesh, perhaps the oldest poem in the world, I read: “Death lives in the house where my bed is and wherever I set my feet, there Death is,” which was consoling, since wherever I set my feet, death was there, too. The older the poetry I read, the better I understood that these massive, difficult sensations going on inside me while I was also making a cheese sauce for lasagne, or pulling wet washing from the drum, were feelings women and men like you and me have been experiencing since the beginning of time. Our society might struggle to provide us with the language of grief in everyday life – I cannot begin to imagine what you are going through – but writers in the Middle Ages had all the words for loss. Pearl, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Beowulf, L’Morte D’Arthur, are full of the images of loss and death and how we survive and endure when we are the ones left alive and those we love are dead. Reading poetry helped me find meaning for what Nell’s death was doing, which was sending me on a quest. Learning how to live without her was the grail I was searching for. Losing someone you love very much and are closer to than anyone else alive, is lonely. No one can feel what you must feel but you. But while Nell’s death felt like it severed a part of me from the past, I also experienced something completely new, which was an urgent, fizzing feeling of life and colour moving somewhere deep inside me, that I couldn’t explain but couldn’t ignore. It was disorientating but oddly beautiful, like putting a kaleidoscope of vivid light over the lens of my life. And grief wasn’t, I was learning, the dark, muted, muffle it’s often described as, but a strange alchemy of violently colliding colours, which represented all the big feelings I had inside me. And poetry – old poetry, Anglo Saxon poetry and Medieval poetry – was the place I found the words I’d been looking for to express this. In my head, I started to spend longer and longer with the knights I met in medieval poetry – Galahad, Gawain, Arthur Pendragon, Lancelot. Rather than asking me to download leaflets or telling me my grief was unimaginable, I felt they were showing me how to move into the future. They had left the security of court – with its roaring fires and jesters and banquets – to quest alone as a way of testing themselves in the same way I was being tested by grief. When I rode into the fields around my home, or even walked down the streets of the small town nearby, I sometimes imagined the knights were with me. They were beautiful and courageous and propelled me forward at a time when every part of me wanted to stretch backwards to the time my sister was last alive. I am grateful to those knights – and the poets who wrote them – since they helped me see grief could, if I chose, be an intensely creative act. Because when someone we love dies, we have an opportunity to create change and evolve, even, much though we might resist that at first. We are left with a life we do not want – since the person we love is dead – but the brutal fact is that this is the only life we have. For a long time after Nell died, I wanted to stretch backwards to return to live in the time when she was alive. I wanted to do this but, of course, I could never get there again. So grief is agony, but after some time I realised this big, unwanted feeling could also be something I could use in a different way, by using it as the impetus to create a life that’s more vivid, because of my experience of becoming acquainted with death, not despite it. This isn’t easy. It requires daily practice to make it happen. It’s also something that will happen to everyone. In our lifetimes, we will all be changed by death. We will all lose people we love who we thought we couldn’t survive without. This is an inescapable fact of life. Our society may not have the language to help us navigate this, but as individuals, we can find our own beautiful, odd ways of getting through it. Horses, poetry and writing my book were where I found this, but as more time passes since Nell died, the more I learn about these beautiful ways we heal through mourning and the extraordinary and normal places we find comfort. Since his daughter, my sister, died, my father has practised his guitar and sung every day. He now sings at open-mic sessions, and I know this is an expression of both the way he misses Nell, and his love for her. I also see the teenage boy who is a friend of my son’s, who shapes his grief for a friend killed last year on a motorbike, by sitting meditating on the riverbank where they fished together; the mother who lost her child to meningitis, setting up a charity that will save thousands of children; the friend who is moving forward from her partner’s death in embroidering stunning, multi-coloured tapestries. There are so many ways grief teaches us new ways to live. And I find solace in the idea that a good life, a vivid life, might be one in which we are, like those knights, called out on our own quest to reimagine and recreate our lives after great loss. Because if you asked Gawain whether his life had more meaning in the safety of court, or out alone as he rode towards the Green Knight’s castle, I think he would reply he was most alive, out there, on his quest. I chose my knights and their poetry to take me across the plains of loss, because they were the symbols that made sense to me. I wonder, what would you choose?

I feel helpless that the perpetrators are thriving ', 'I have been bullied, laughed at and been at the receiving end of various (probably unconscious) biases that resulted in me having to change jobs multiple times. I consider myself fortunate that every job change has proven to be the right step upwards in my career, but I can’t reconcile myself with the facts that those perpetrators are carrying on and thriving as if nothing has happened. I regularly wake up at 3am with a pounding chest as all that trauma comes back to me, and feel sheer anger and helplessness against what seems to be a real injustice. Eleanor says: Once when I was in a lather about the fact that Very Bad People can move through the world more or less unpunished, someone who was trying to be helpful said, “you know, the best revenge is to live your own life well”. I said, “No, the best revenge would be they go to jail.” I’ve come to think we’d both said something true. They were right that indefinite anger does not by itself do anything to correct the moral score. Anger that goes unexpressed, anger that isn’t harnessed, anger that wakes up without warning somewhere behind the sternum – can curdle inside the wrong person so the victim of an unfairness just ends up getting hurt twice. But I was right that the scales of justice can hang tilted for far too long. Sometimes the reason we hunger for punishment or recrimination isn’t just bloodthirstiness or a wish to strike back, adder-like, at something that threatened us. It’s a way of demanding the acknowledgment that the original insult denied. Of course, it would be preferable if they had an epiphany all on their own and agreed we deserve acknowledgment. But if we can’t have that, at least getting them to face consequences for their actions forces them to experience what they should have known all along: that what they did wasn’t OK, that we matter, and so does what they did. It seems to me that the task for moving past this injustice is to chart a way between these two truths: to find something that sates the desire to feel acknowledged without consuming you and keeping you awake. I don’t know the details of what these people said or did to you, nor how egregiously it violated anti-discrimination laws and policies where you live. I don’t know whether you have access to any formal remedies, or whether it would pragmatically be worth pursuing them. But the fact that this took place in a workplace adds indignity, and I wonder whether righting that indignity could help make this feel closed. You could use your skills and professionalism – the very things these people impugned – to make a formal list of what happened, when, and with whom, in as clinical a way as possible. You could leave that paper trail with a friend or former colleague, or even HR at a former company (though treat this one with caution, and know what processes will be triggered if you do). This may give you somewhere to put the intrusive memories when they appear, in a way that feels like harnessing them, rather than letting them harness you. You don’t need to send it to anyone implicated, and even if you do, don’t hold your breath for an apology. Ransoming our happiness to a wrongdoer’s reaction is a sure way to be disappointed. If you find that these feelings don’t pass with time, professional therapy can be a wonderful tool for acknowledging past trauma while keeping it in the past. But perhaps using your professionalism and equanimity to create your own record of what happened here could mean your own anger is not the only witness.

Should I confront him? ', 'In late 2020, during lockdown, I met a nice guy. We started dating and our relationship developed at a rapid pace. Six months into our relationship, I found an email on his computer  from his university sweetheart.  When we first met, he had told me about her, and how, 20 years before, he was in love with her and wanted to marry her, but his family disapproved. She later got married to someone else, and he moved on with his life. The email was a short correspondence about general things, nothing “out of line”. Still, I was upset he was still in touch with her. A month later I confronted him and he explained that she had contacted him before we met to tell him that she forgave him. He told me that getting back in touch with her was a relief to him, as the heartbreak he experienced  never left him – and even acted as a barrier in future relationships. Soon after, we moved in together and got married. Then, one day, I was able to access his phone and saw messages between them. They had been talking to each other for months over Facebook. Two hours of video calls – we never talked for more than 20 minutes over the phone! The last phone call was two weeks before he asked me to move in with him. I try to tell myself that this was a turning point for him – that it was only after talking to her that he realised things were serious between us. I would like to believe that he told her about me moving in, which is why they stopped talking suddenly. But I am deeply hurt. I know he loves me, and I love him. I just don’t get why he did that. What if she gets in touch with him again? What would happen? If she got back in touch, why should the message from your husband be any different from what it has been since he’s met you? What do you think might change? I don’t know if you are obsessed with the past (or more accurately, his past) because you do sense something is going on – or because you are self-sabotaging, for whatever reason. Some people do stay in touch with exes, and some don’t. What about your exes? I know when I had my first serious relationship I couldn’t believe my then partner was in touch with his ex, but as I grew up and accrued my own “past”, I realised that, sometimes, things aren’t straightforward. Clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst Stephen Blumenthal had some interesting perspectives. First, he felt that the fact you met in lockdown is not to be underestimated: “It wasn’t at a normal social pace, where you see each other in between going back to your normal life; you were forced together. In these situations, the relationship can develop very rapidly and be idealised, then there’s a crash when reality intrudes.” You mention yourself, in your longer letter, that this was at a rapid pace for you; I wonder if it was too quick. You mention you didn’t know about the Facebook conversations until after you were married – would they have changed your mind? Blumenthal wanted to stress that “you have every right to confront this and you shouldn’t feel you had to wait a month to do so”. It’s important to know yourself, and ask for what you need, thereby giving your partner the chance to provide that – or not. There’s no point reasoning away your doubts and fears and pretending they don’t exist. Doing so negates those needs and provides fertile soil for resentment and separation to flourish. You mention, in your longer letter, about needing to feel safe. “We all have a need for ‘psychological safety’,” says Blumenthal. “You’ll need to fully explore how you feel with your husband, and he’ll need to understand those feelings.” Telling your husband how his being in touch with his ex made you feel is a clear communication of your needs. That’s scary, because it makes you vulnerable, and he may not meet them, but it’s also ultimately empowering. However, you will have to admit you went in to his phone.

Most people go through a period of anxiety over the questions “Who am I sexually?” and “Am I normal?” In fact, these questions can only elicit artificial answers, since fully knowing oneself can be a very long process involving a great deal of experimentation. And when it comes to sex, “normality” is not really a useful construct. Instead, of obsessing about ‘Who am I’, ask yourself why you feel the need to label yourself at all. Try to inoculate yourself from the ubiquitous societal tendency to pigeonhole – and focus instead on responding to your true desire for a person of any gender when it arises. Allow yourself to seek genuine human connection and pure pleasure without self judgment or fear of being judged.

Should I give up? ', 'The question I’ve had some short relationships, been on many dates, and had one long-term relationship (a while ago now) where I was dumped on the day before we planned to get married. I put a lot of effort into online dating, but the final straw was sending quality personal messages to 47 different women over six months and receiving nil positive replies. I’m in my late 50s, slim, fit, tall, of average and conventional appearance, articulate, humorous and intelligent. From hard work and living modestly, I have been able to retire and now volunteer for a charity – the task is mainly helping the sick and disabled. I also co-run a local social group for get-togethers and outings to help not only me, but others, to meet people. I discount those who are too old, those who I wouldn’t go on a see-saw with, and women who say, “Done that and got the T-shirt” about relationships – and there’s rarely anyone left. I’ve recently dated someone who talked long-term only to end it abruptly without giving a reason. This has been devastating. We only ever hugged, but this reminded me what is absent from my cold life. I have thoroughly disproved the saying “There’s someone for everyone.” There obviously isn’t. Should I resign myself to being alone for the rest of my days? Or should I keep trying and hoping to meet someone special, knowing that repeatedly failing is damaging to my self-esteem and my mental health? Philippa’s answer I probably get more emails on this topic than any other. Like you they are well-meaning and proactive about meeting people. And, like you, they’ve had bad luck. I’ve been saying: make yourself vulnerable; dare to share your feelings first; be who you really are rather than who you think you ought to be; and if someone doesn’t like you, that’s about them, don’t take it too personally. But your email has alerted me to something I may have been missing. And that is, lack of success can cause bitterness and resentment to build up. You’ve noticed it in some of the women in your social group – the ones who say, “Done that and got the T-shirt” – which got me wondering whether you are wearing one of those metaphorical T-shirts, too. Could a resigned pessimism, with a side order of bitterness, be leaking out of you? When we’ve been hurt, we build up defences; but if we do that, no one can get in. The “see-saw” comment is problematic. It sounds like you are referring to weight. This attitude may make you appear as though you are searching for a commodity to use rather than a person to relate to. People will pick up on that. Who wants to be chosen just because they’re slim? Don’t think of online dating like shopping: the perfect person is not out there. Settle for someone in the ballpark instead and when you each allow the other’s influence and dare to be flexible you just might become each other’s number one. Don’t think of yourself as just the chooser either; allow yourself to be found, too. I expect you are a nice person. And I believe most other people in your situation are also lovely, but it’s understandable that you may be wary after having been left at the altar, ghosted and rejected – but too much wariness is no help when you’re looking for intimacy. If the women who replied sounded negative, maybe, like you, they have been worn down by using dating apps. Perhaps that’s something you could ask the next time you use one of these apps. The counting of the messages made me laugh, but remember this is dating, not writing an academic paper – you have nothing to prove. There’s a hint of something else that might be putting people off – and that is how certain you seem about some things. Try to keep more of an open mind, embrace more of “don’t know” and less of being sure of what people are like and whether you’d get on with them. Put judgment to one side (people can smell “judgy” from a mile off). The way you judge your appearance and character also gives me a hint that this is how you might be judging potential dates, too. No more putting people in boxes and, anyway, your type might not be your type. Your “too old” also rang alarm bells for me. If you are only going for people younger than you, it could explain the lack of replies to your messages. You don’t have to write off ever meeting anyone and you can still get on with the rest of your life and aim to relish it as much as possible, with or without a long-term relationship. You don’t know whether you will find a partner or not and you’ll need to get comfortable with that uncertainty. Put in less effort, go on dates and outings to have fun, and don’t treat dating like an interview or a task. Be open, be you and prioritise enjoying yourself. You really don’t know what may develop.

(699, 'https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/23/alexei-navalny-documentary-film', 9, 'guardian', '  ‘All I could do was film’: the making of a shocking movie on Alexei Navalny ', 'In an interview broadcast last weekend, Jake Tapper of CNN put it to Volodymyr Zelenskiy that he might not survive the war with Russia and asked how he would want to be remembered. “A human being that loved life to the fullest and loved his family and loved his motherland – definitely not a hero,” the Ukrainian president replied through an interpreter. “I want people to take me as I am: a regular human.” At the opening of the documentary Navalny, director Daniel Roher poses a similar question to Russian opposition leader, lawyer and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny: if he is killed, what is his message to the Russian people? Navalny challenges the premise: “Oh, come on, Daniel! No, no way. It’s like you’re making movie for the case of my death!” At that moment Navalny looks indomitable, a charismatic and courageous figure relaxing in a moodily lit restaurant in Germany. But today, less than 18 months later, he is languishing in a Russian prison while President Vladimir Putin wages a war that many call genocidal. Roher had no desire to chronicle a death foretold but understands the preciousness of what he recorded: “This was the last interview Alexei would give for many years. Maybe ever.” If Roher had a dollar for every time someone told him his film was prescient or timely, he would be a billionaire by now. The 98-minute Navalny premiered in January at a virtual Sundance Film Festival where it won both the documentary audience award and the festival favourite award. As Lindsey Bahr, a film writer for the Associated Press, put it, Navalny contains shadowy operatives, truth-seeking journalists, conspiracy theories, Soviet-era poisons and a handsome, altruistic family man risking his life to fight a would-be despot. She added: “Navalny is so taut and suspenseful you’d think John le Carré had left behind a secret manuscript that’s only just coming to light now.” Its subject is, like Zelenskiy, undeniably telegenic and invariably dressed for action rather than in suit and tie. He also has a story to tell. Now 45, Navalny grew up in a series of closed military towns outside Moscow, the son of a Red Army communications officer and an economist. He spent summers at his grandmother’s cottage in the Ukrainian countryside near Chernobyl. But when he was nine, in 1986, Navalny’s uncle made sure the visit did not happen because of an explosion at the nuclear power plant in Chernobyl. The Soviet government’s efforts to cover up the disaster, and his family’s related health problems, are said to have forged Navalny’s distrust of authority and desire for transparency. Roher recounts: “He told me these stories about how his grandmother would send his father a smoked salmon in the mail and his mother would bury it in the garden because she knew that it was pulsating with radioactive material.” Navalny studied law, took corrupt state organisations to court and blogged about the outcome. He released reports about corruption in the Putin administration, endured arrests and intimidation and tried to run for president. He also showed mastery of social media; his younger fans are all over TikTok. At one point in the film, Navalny tells Roher that he believed his celebrity might make him safer. The director can be heard replying: “Boy, were you wrong.” Navalny acknowledges with a chuckle: “Yes, I was very wrong.” Roher, a 28-year-old Canadian best known for Once Were Brothers: Robbie Robertson and the Band, has never been to Russia. But he had extraordinary access during Navalny’s brief stay in Germany in late 2020 and early 2021 as the opposition star recovered from being poisoned and sought the truth behind the failed assassination attempt. The director recalls: “When you meet him for the first time, he’s a bit reserved. It was a weird context in which we were meeting and he was trying to get a vibe for us. But he and I became fast friends. He’s funny and charming and he’s the world’s best documentary subject: there’s nothing I could ask him to do or film that he wouldn’t let me do or film. “He has that quality that is often ascribed to master politicians, making you feel like you’re the only guy in the room, like you are important. That’s how I was made to feel when I met him for the first time but I had to be mindful that, in order for this film to work, I had to make this documentary with a critical gaze towards him. “This could not be a hero worshipping piece and I think he appreciated the integrity of that approach. To his credit, there was nothing that he wouldn’t let me ask him about. There was nothing off limits.” To illustrate the point, there is the troubling question of Navalny’s flirtations with the far right early in his career. Last year Amnesty International stripped him of “prisoner of conscience” status after reviewing comments he made 15 years ago – including a video that appears to compare immigrants to cockroaches – that they found amounted to hate speech. Roher quizzes him about having marched alongside nationalists and racists. Navalny responds that coalition-building is a means to the end of defeating a totalitarian regime: “I consider it’s my political superpower,” he insists. “I can talk to everyone. “Anyway, well, they are citizens of Russian Federation and if I want to fight Putin, if I want to be leader of a country, I cannot just ignore the huge part of it. There are lot of people who call themselves nationalists. OK, let’s discuss it.” The exchange brings to mind a line from Bertolt Brecht’s 1943 play Life of Galileo: “Unhappy the land that needs heroes.” Speaking from a New York hotel, Roher reflects: “Here’s a guy who was seeking the presidency of the biggest country in the world. Absolutely he must be scrutinised. Absolutely his past affiliation with these unsavoury characters must be questioned. We must understand what motivated him, what his political positions are and, to that effect, I must say he’s a really good sport. “I think the cornerstone of Alexei’s political philosophy is that debate and discussion is critical for a healthy democracy. He doesn’t shy away from answering tough questions. I hope I didn’t shy away from asking them. Of course, it was critically important. The film wouldn’t work if we didn’t do that.” But did Roher find Navalny’s answers about the dubious company he has kept satisfactory? “At the end of the day, Alexei is operating in the context of Russian politics, which is nebulous and complex and mysterious and candidly I don’t fully understand it. I don’t speak Russian. This is not my area of expertise. “But if he is to believed at his word, the way he perceives this is that he’s trying to build this coalition to defeat the authoritarian regime and that means having to engage with people that are unsavoury, that are not good characters. That’s a political calculation. “It essentially boils down to the enemy of my enemy is my friend and, while I don’t agree with that as someone who grew up in Canada as a liberal, I understand what motivates him, and I understand why he holds those positions and why he’s willing to engage with those type of individuals.” The film includes testimony from Navalny’s wife, Yulia, and daughter Dasha, who is studying in the US. Roher was stunned by their support for Navalny’s ambitions. “He has a spine made of steel, a character made of iron, and his family is right there with him. These are extraordinarily strong people. “Imagine being put through what Yulia has been put through and she’s poised and dignified with the air of the future first lady. It’s a stunning thing to witness and that matriculates down to his children Dasha and [son] Zakhar. How devastating it must be for them to have their father so far away and inaccessible. But I think the family understands that what he’s trying to accomplish is vital and important.” The central drama of the documentary is the poisoning of Navalny on a flight from Siberia to Moscow in August 2020; it includes footage in which he can be heard moaning like a man under torture. The pilot staged an emergency landing in Omsk where Navalny was immediately hospitalised. Yulia and supporters helped make the case for him to be treated elsewhere and he was soon transported to Berlin for medical care. After he emerged from a coma, the German government determined that he had been poisoned with novichok, a lethal Soviet-era nerve agent. The Kremlin denied the allegation. The film shows Navalny working with the investigative journalists Christo Grozev and Maria Pevchikh to track down his suspected poisoners. That staple of detective movies, an evidence board with faces linked by pieces of string, is on the wall with Putin’s face at the top. In one riveting scene at a rented Airbnb in Germany’s Black Forest, Navalny, pretending to be an aide to a top Federal Security Service (FSB) official, calls the suspects one by one on speakerphone – early in the morning to catch them off guard. Roher remembers it vividly. “I asked Christo the night before what his expectations were for the plan that they had hatched to call the murderers and Christo wrote it off and said it might be good for the film, it might not, who knows, but let’s just shoot it. “We did five or six phone calls before they got [FSB operative] Konstantin Kudryavtsev on the line. I don’t speak a word of Russian but, if you were there, you didn’t have to speak the language to understand something extraordinary was happening. “Maria Pevchikh’s jaw was unhinged, it hit the floor, and I understood that whoever was on the other end of this phone was duped. They got him and he spilled the beans and I’m just grateful that Niki Waltl [director of photography] and myself were there to capture it.” The documentary climaxes with Navalny’s January 2021 flight back to Russia where he knows that he will be immediately arrested and imprisoned. Roher cannot forget his last hours with Navalny. “I remember how palpable the stress was and Navalny, the nucleus of this moment, trying his very best to be light and buoyant but the energy was so heavy and thick. I was there in the hotel room trying to be invisible, not doing a good job because the first thing he did was he started screaming at me and then he apologised. “We didn’t know what was going to happen. We didn’t know if he’d get arrested. We didn’t know if he would be shot when he got to the airport. All we knew was that this was a man who was guided by his convictions, who could not be dissuaded, who was going back come hell or high water into the lion’s den. And all I could do was film.” Navalny was greeted by supporters in Moscow but quickly detained. After a year in jail, he was sentenced last month to nine more years for fraud in a case that the US state department condemned as a “sham ruling”. Defiant as ever, Navalny tweeted: “9 years. Well, as the characters of my favorite TV series The Wire’ used to say: You only do two days. That’s the day you go in and the day you come out.’” He has also urged protests against the war in Ukraine and this week suggested that a man killed in a Ukrainian village, Ilya Ivanovich Navalny, may have been targeted for his last name by the Russian military. Roher says: “I know that Alexei reads all the press for the film so, while I don’t have direct communication with him, I like to talk to him through interviews. So I’ll just give him a little shout-out and let him know that we’re thinking about him and I hope he’s doing well. We’d have a lot of fun if he were here on our film tour.” In a crackdown on opposition activists and independent journalists, Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation was last year labeled an extremist organisation by the Kremlin. It is now operating outside Russia but continues to investigate government corruption. As his war goes badly, Putin is crushing dissent with new zeal. The film ends as it began, with Roher asking Navalny what message he would leave behind for the Russian people if he is killed. The message is simple: never give up. Though they are now thousands of miles apart, Roher has no doubt that Navalny still wants to be the first democratically elected president of what he calls “the beautiful Russia of the future”. “I just hope that Alexei is able to stay alive, that the public attention that the film is receiving will dissuade the authorities from murdering him in prison. I hope that he has the ability to one day get out and walk his daughter down the aisle and live his life and, if he decides to run for the presidency again, to run for the presidency again. But it’s all of course built on him surviving this horrible moment of his life.” Navalny premieres on CNN and CNN+ on Sunday at 9pm and is shown in the UK on BBC Two on Monday at 9pm', 'Sat 23 Apr 2022 07.02 BSTLast modified on Sat 23 Apr 2022 07.54 BST');

On the one hand, the outpouring of patriotic pageantry will provide a perfect distraction from all the terrible things her family keeps doing. But on the other, she’s going to have to sit through an awful lot of faff. This week, the centrepiece of this faff was announced. Set within the grounds of Windsor Castle, the Queen’s platinum jubilee celebration will take place in front of a live audience of 4,000, and reportedly cover 400 years of British history. Helen Mirren will play Queen Elizabeth I and deliver a speech from 1588. There will be a long section about the Gunpowder Plot. There will be a lot of horses; 500 of them, in fact. And Katherine Jenkins. And Ant and Dec. It sounds tortuous. The Queen has had to put up with this sort of thing for 70 years now. You can’t help but feel that she’d probably just prefer a quiet night in with the snooker. As tedious as the whole thing sounds, one thing alone will save the day. That thing, slightly unbelievably, is Tom Cruise. The show will reportedly be formed of four acts. Mirren will host one, Damian Lewis, Adjoa Andoh and Alan Titchmarsh will host the others, but they are all set to be blasted out of the water by Cruise’s turn. Nobody knows why this is happening or how it came to be, but it doesn’t matter. You will watch the Queen’s platinum jubilee celebration, just because someone booked Tom Cruise for it. Realistically, nobody knows which Cruise will turn up. We may get the showboating action star, who will arrive on stage after leaping out of an exploding fighter jet before singlehandedly foiling the Gunpowder Plot by karate-kicking Guy Fawkes’s head clean off his shoulders. We may get overly reverent Cruise, who will be so humbled by his surroundings that he’ll lose focus and mangle the word “Leicestershire” beyond all recognition. If he wants to make friends, he’ll turn up with a T-shirt cannon loaded with coconut cake and blast slices straight into the mouths of his audience. If he wants to be memorable, he could Man v Food his way through a pile of identical curries. We simply just don’t know. However, it would be wrong to assume that he can waltz into Windsor and run away with the whole show. If the Queen does turn up to watch the thing – and that’s still a big if, given her recent health concerns – then Cruise runs the risk of being second banana to Titchmarsh. I mean it. If you’re the Queen, Titchmarsh is always going to be the real draw here. Think of all the shows the woman has been forced to endure in the last 20 years alone. Brian May played guitar on her roof and she couldn’t crack a smile. Atomic Kitten sang Dancing in the Street and she couldn’t have looked more bored. At this stage in her life, the woman has been subjected to the equivalent of 300 hours of elongated Paul McCartney Hey Jude singalongs, and the strain is definitely showing. Perhaps the closest thing to Cruise that the Queen has ever encountered is the James Bond skit she performed at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics, in which she pretended to jump out of a helicopter. Remember, this was Bond – a decades-old touchstone of British culture – and the woman scowled through the whole thing like she had a gun to her head. You sense that maybe, just maybe, she might not have seen Vanilla Sky. The only time that the Queen has palpably expressed any enthusiasm for anything in public is that gif where she saw some cows, pointed at them and delightedly shouted the word “Cows!”. Titchmarsh is the personification of that cow gif. He’s all dirty fingernails and wax jackets. If the Queen can summon the energy to attend this event, it will be solely so she can see him, point at him and shout “Titchmarsh!”. Cruise might be one of the most famous men of all time, but even he can’t compete with star power like that.', 'Fri 22 Apr 2022 13.19 BSTLast modified on Sat 23 Apr 2022 10.25 BST'),

But has that spoiled the joke – if that is the correct word? This is a self-aware action comedy whose title is possibly the funniest bit, riffing on Milan Kundera’s The Unbearable Lightness of Being as well as possibly Dave Eggers’s memoir A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius. Producer-star Cage plays “Nick Cage”: Hollywood ledge and national treasure (to quote a relevant movie title) now in a midlife crisis, haunted by CGI-doppelganger visions of his angry younger self, no longer booking the big roles and facing a grim future in which, as his agent (Neil Patrick Harris) puts it, he plays the cool gay uncle in a Duplass brothers film. Cage is living in a hotel, estranged from his wife Olivia (a thanklessly unfunny role for Sharon Horgan) and moody teen daughter Addy (Lily Mo Sheen), who hates the movie classics he tries introducing her to. (I was waiting for Addy to declare herself instead a massive fan of movies by the Coppola family. Maybe that would be an in-joke too far.) Cash-strapped Cage is forced to accept a million-dollar appearance fee at the spectacular luxury home of a billionaire plutocrat Javi Gutierrez (Pedro Pascal) who is a besotted superfan. But then the CIA gets word to our hero that Javi is a dangerous cartel gangster and Cage must use his privileged access to bring him down. There are some entertaining meta-touches here, but the entire Gutierrez plot is strained and borderline dull. Pascal isn’t a natural comic and the movie winds up fudging his crucial bad-guy status. As for Cage, this isn’t like Leslie Nielsen sending up his erstwhile straight-lead image for Airplane! and The Naked Gun, nor is it exactly like John Malkovich fabricating a complex fictional self in Being John Malkovich. Cage simply plays Cage in the moderate script he’s been given, in that utterly committed, strangely uncomplicated way that has won the hearts of fans who declare themselves on the right side of the laugh-with/laugh-at dividing line. But Cage has already done a far more interesting postmodern film about the film business – Spike Jonze’s Adaptation, written by Charlie Kaufman, in which Cage gave a far better (dual) performance in a much funnier and better written film as the tormented screenwriter-artist Charlie Kaufman and his middlebrow twin brother Donald.

The original French title is “Un Monde” – “A World” – and the playground is a universe of fear which we all edit out of our adult memories. A rather amazing seven-year-old newcomer called Maya Vanderbeque stars as Nora, seen mostly in extreme, searching closeup. Just the opening shot of her crying face supplies pretty much enough emotional charge to power the whole film. Nora is just starting school, and her sobbing mini-drama-queen distress at the school gates discomforts her dad (Karim Leklou) and especially her older brother Abel (Günter Duret), a wannabe tough guy who doesn’t want his clingy kid sister embarrassing him in the playground. When she witnesses him being bullied by the other boys – with whom Abel had hoped to bully someone else – she tells the teachers and her dad, thus humiliating him and breaking a whole unwritten statute book about not snitching. At first, Nora artlessly tries informing on the bullies to her own teacher, Mme Agnès (Laura Verlinden) whose ineffective attempts at rebuking the boys appears to irritate their teacher, whose prerogative this actually is, and who perhaps sees Mme Agnès’s intervention as an implied criticism of her professionalism. And so at the crucial moment she has neither the time nor the inclination to back her up: a fatal concession. And when Nora’s dad clumsily tries yelling at the bullies, it naturally makes things far worse, a mishandled situation which metastasises horribly. A world of adult indifference is revealed: those supposed authority figures are way out of the frame, as remote as the uniformed prison guards patrolling the exercise yard. As with Yasmin Reza’s stage-play Carnage, filmed by Roman Polanski in 2011, or perhaps the enigmatic schoolgates scene that closes Michael Haneke’s 2005 film Hidden, the power politics of kids has implications for the adults. The playground’s hidden theatre of violence echoes in the headteacher’s office and in the kitchens at home, among the grownups whose own childhoods involved dutifully learning the lesson that violence is unacceptable – but who find that anger is still a natural instinct when it comes to protecting and being seen to protect. As for Nora herself, the film shows us that she is not exactly a moral agent: she fiercely objects to bullying, but also unhelpfully denounces Abel’s failure to stand up for himself and objects to anyone’s failure to take her feelings into account. It is her tactless courage and willingness to intervene that is finally to make a difference – but she is also a bit of an egotist. There is a telling scene in which she hugs her beloved Mme Agnès with that same theatrically possessive desperation she showed in the opening shot, which makes the teacher just the tiniest bit impatient with her. At just 72 minutes, this is a brief, intense feature: it’s possible that Wandel envisaged it as even shorter than it actually is, and perhaps its narrative tendons slacken a little after the initial spasm of horror. But what an incredible performance from Vanderbeque: an intuition of fear and pain and moral outrage that goes beyond acting.

Another boy around the same age, more shabbily dressed and serious looking, is asked what life is about. He chews his bottom lip: “Life is something that is filled with difficulty.” This often heartbreaking, painful documentary from Ashkan Nejati and Mehran Nematollahi has a simple premise: interviewing Iranian schoolkids to camera about their lives, school, homework and hopes for the future. It’s a sequel of sorts to godfather of modern Iranian cinema Abbas Kiarostami’s 1989 documentary Homework, which put the same questions to children growing up in the shadow of the Iran-Iraq war. The new film features plenty of kids-say-the-funniest-things moments. A boy is asked which countries he’d like to visit? “Europe, America … Neptune!” And there’s some commentary on the Iranian education system. But what lingers is the film’s devastating snapshot of the gap between rich and poor. One of the rich kids, a placid round-faced boy, brags about how well-off his dad is and how many cars they’ve got. The interviewer gently probes him: do you know what wealth is? “Yes, someone who has a lot of cash like my dad.” Do you know what poverty is? “No.” If he ever watches the film he’ll find out. You can spot the poor kids instantly, and not just from their faded, many-times-washed sweaters and DIY haircuts. It’s their clenched body language and lined-before-their-time serious faces – a reminder that for them there’s no time for silliness or play. The headteacher of these boys explains that in calendar years, they are eight to 10, but maturity wise, more like 17 or 18. Most work afternoons and evenings, selling goods on the street or busking. One boy explains how he burns newspaper and rubs the soot on his face to look dirtier, more pitiable. Another pays his family’s rent and food. “I don’t buy toys. When you need to fill your belly, you don’t buy toys.” It’s not an easy watch, but these kids are invisible enough without the world shutting its eyes.

The setting is provincial France in 1963, just before the permissive society and the pop culture revolution – and certainly before the legalisation of abortion, which did not happen in France until 1975. Newcomer Anamaria Vartolomei plays Anne Duchesne, a very talented student of literature who in one scene stuns her professor and classmates by knowing what “anaphora” is. Her hardworking mum and dad, Gabrielle and Jacques (played by Sandrine Bonnaire and Eric Verdin) run a bar, and Gabrielle is endlessly proud of her daughter, at one stage giving her some money and saying: “Buy yourself a novel!” But Anne is pregnant. With mounting suppressed panic, she waits for her period and repeatedly writes “rien” in her diary. Her future is about to be destroyed but even asking for an abortion is to risk a jail sentence for you and anyone else who helps – or fails to denounce you. Anne’s escalating dread of the hostile entity within her body reminded me of the mood in Rosemary’s Baby (written and filmed in about the same era). Satan doesn’t have to be the father for a woman to feel horror and shame, and for the male authorities of medicine and law to make it clear she is guilty of a terrible sin, from which the men are mysteriously exempt. Diwan’s movie is cleverly structured so that we do not at first know who the father is, and there is no scene showing the moment of conception. The drama mimics Anne’s own sense of denial, her own refusal to remember or imagine the catastrophe. What we get instead are clinical inspections functioning as chilling parodies or inversions of that sexual intimacy that has upended her life. We see Anne undressing and checking her heart-rendingly pristine underwear for signs of a period; we see her lying half naked and submitting to an examination by the stern male doctor who contemptuously brushes aside Anne’s timid protestations of virginity and delivers the diagnosis. And Vartolomei’s controlled, focused performance shows us Anne’s ordeal, as she carries on as normal while trying to decide what to do: hanging out with her friends, going to lectures, furtively looking at anatomical dictionaries in that pre-web world. She mustn’t tell anyone that she has in fact been catapulted forward into that grim secret future of womanly submission. Happening takes a different line on abortion than a film like, say, Mike Leigh’s Vera Drake from 2004 or Cristian Mungiu’s 4 Months, 3 Weeks & 2 Days from 2007, films that focused with a more ironised chill on the abortionist; this is about the pregnant woman herself. One of the most startling scenes in the film comes when Anne’s flirty (but virginal) roommate Brigitte (Louise Orry-Diquéro) demonstrates to her and their quiet, watchful friend Hélène (Luàna Bajrami) the sexual position she’s heard is the best: she sits astride a pillow and begins to undulate. As Hélène glances with alarm at Anne, Brigitte starts moaning with eyes closed, having apparently forgotten anyone else is there. What is Anne thinking: that Brigitte is naive? Or that this is indeed pleasure, the pleasure that destroyed her life? Perhaps she is thinking that Brigitte doesn’t yet know the price to be paid for this pleasure: or perhaps Anne is envious in her misery, remembering how little pleasure and how little sexual expertise has gone into her own unsentimental education.  Happening is released on 22 April in cinemas.', 'Wed 20 Apr 2022 13.00 BSTLast modified on Thu 21 Apr 2022 16.24 BST'),

Embiid practiced Friday and is reportedly expected to play in Game 4 of the Philadelphia 76ers\' first-round series against the Toronto Raptors. He could get an MRI in the near future to figure out just how the bad injury is, but that has not been set yet. According to Shams Charania, there is fear that Embiid is dealing with a torn ligament in that thumb, but Embiid has vowed to keep playing through the injury. Embiid has been stellar throughout the first round. His 76ers are one win away from sweeping the Raptors out of the playoffs. Embiid is averaging just under 28 points and 13 rebounds in the series, and in Game 3, he made a 3-pointer with 0.9 seconds left on the clock in overtime to give the 76ers the win over the Raptors. \n                                                \n    By submitting my email I agree to receive the \"CBS Sports HQ Newsletter\" and other marketing and promotional emails from CBS Sports, which may include information from our affiliates and/or partners\' offers, products and services.

Though he missed only one game last year, a knee injury limited him in the 2021 playoffs. He similarly struggled to stay on the floor during the 2019 postseason, and he obviously missed the first two seasons of his career due to injury. While Embiid is perhaps the best player in the NBA when healthy, durability has always been a major concern of his. If the Sixers take care of business in Game 4 on Saturday, Embiid would likely have some time to rest before starting the second round, which will presumably come against the Miami Heat. The 76ers need Embiid to be at 100 percent if they plan to seriously compete for the championship this season.

We\'ve certainly seen Giannis Antetokounmpo win games on his own by putting up absurd numbers, but asking him to do it all can\'t be Plan A.  Luckily, Milwaukee never really needed Giannis to go completely nuclear on offense. In the first five minutes of the game for the Bucks, center Bobby Portis drained two 3-pointers, Brook Lopez netted a triple of his own and Jrue Holiday had two smooth finishes at the rim. It was the bulk of what resulted in a 17-9 lead for the Bucks, forcing the Bulls to take their first timeout of the game. That early onslaught from the role players ended up being a taste of what was to come for the rest of the night as Milwaukee rolled Chicago to a 111-81 win. Giannis finished the game with a modest stat line of 18 points, nine assists and seven rebounds, while only taking 12 shots and playing 29 minutes. The reason for that \"quiet\" night from the two-time league MVP was because of the production the Bucks were getting from everyone else. Grayson Allen finished with a playoff career high of 22 points, Portis tacked on 18 points, Holiday had 16 and Pat Connaughton finished with 11 points. It was the exact type of effort Milwaukee needed as it faced a raucous United Center crowd without its second-best player available. \"The whole group played well tonight,\" Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said after the game. \"The guys off the bench were great, the starters were great. It takes all of us.\"  \n                                                \n    By submitting my email I agree to receive the \"CBS Sports HQ Newsletter\" and other marketing and promotional emails from CBS Sports, which may include information from our affiliates and/or partners\' offers, products and services. For more information about our data practices consult our Privacy Policy\n                         Although Milwaukee got significant help from several players, the night belonged to Allen, who went from putting up a combined three points in the first two games of this series to draining five 3-pointers en route to his career night. \"Mentally my mindset [in my role] was the same, maybe I was a little bit quicker to shoot some of those catch-and-shoot shots I got, but I think it was just being in different spots,\" Allen said after the game. \"Some of those spots that Khris is usually in on offense -- top of the key, playing off of post-ups, isolations -- I was there and got the ball swung [to me] and they collapsed hard on Giannis and Jrue all game long so I was able to take advantage of that.\" Allen\'s performance was reminiscent of a stretch of the schedule early in the season when Middleton was sidelined for eight games with COVID-19. During that span, Allen started in each game and averaged 18.3 points while shooting 50.7 percent from deep on over eight attempts a game. While he came off the bench in this game, his role was still the same. Knock down shots when the defense collapsed on Giannis and Holliday, get to the rim if the option was available and be aggressive on defense.  He certainly delivered in all three of those areas, and although the Bucks might not be able to bank on Allen putting up over 20 points every night, he\'s an important piece to the puzzle for Milwaukee as it tries to navigate this series without Middleton. \"He\'s a confident shooter,\" Budenholzer said. \"I think the thing with Grayson, he\'s great off the bounce too. I think people underestimate how he can attack closeouts and drive it. We need that balance. We need some guys that can be on the backside and beat guys off the dribble.\" Looking ahead to the rest of the series, Milwaukee will need players such as Allen, Portis and Connaughton to remain aggressive and confident in their shot as the Bulls will continue to give a bulk of their defensive attention to Antetokounmpo and Holliday. All three of those guys showed up in Game 3, now we\'ll have to see if it can carry over to the rest of the series as the Bulls try to adjust for Game 4 on Sunday. ', '\n                                \n            \n    \n                    \n    Apr 23, 2022\n          '),

Brunson is quick and agile in the backcourt, allowing him to blow by his defender and finish strong at the rim. The Villanova product is also reliable from the perimeter. The 2018 second-rounder is averaging a team-best 32 points, 5.3 rebounds and five assists per game. In his last contest, Brunson dropped 31 points and five assists.  Guard Spencer Dinwiddie is a smart and smooth distributor who consistently creates his own shot. Dinwiddie has excellent size and length at the guard position, allowing him to cause havoc on defense and shoot right over his defender. The Colorado product is second on the team in scoring (19.7) and first in assists (6.7). In the Game 2 victory, he finished with 20 points, five rebounds and six assists.  Guard Donovan Mitchell is an excellent scorer, defender and playmaker with terrific athleticism. Mitchell plays with elite balance and agility to blow by opposing defenders. The three-time All-Star can also barrel his way to the rim and finish through contact. Mitchell is averaging a team-best 32.7 points, 3.3 rebounds and 5.7 assists per game. In his last game, Mitchell recorded 32 points and six assists.  Forward Bojan Bogdanovic is an elite 3-point shooter who can put the ball on the deck. Bogdanovic knows how to create space on the perimeter to consistently find open looks. The 2011 second-rounder is logging 25 points, 5.3 rebounds and is shooting 41 percent from 3-point land in the series. He\'s scored 24-plus in three straight games, including 24 points and going 4-for-7 from beyond the arc in Game 3.  SportsLine\'s model is leaning over on the total, projecting the teams to combine for 224 points.

CBS Sports will be providing daily picks for the duration of the postseason. Sam Quinn will make at least one pick for every game between now and the NBA Finals. All lines courtesy of Caesars Sportsbook. Philadelphia won Game 3 by exactly three points. That\'s the spread on this game, but there\'s reason to trust Toronto to at least stave off the sweep in this one. We now know Joel Embiid is dealing with a thumb injury, for instance, and perhaps more importantly, the Raptors know it as well and can adjust how they defend him. It\'s also worth noting that all five Raptors starters shot below 50 percent from the field in Game 3 and Toronto still managed to force overtime. Philly should have this series in hand, but the Raptors won\'t go down without a fight. The pick: Raptors +3 As many have pointed out, the Mavericks didn\'t run any set plays in the fourth quarter. They literally just let Jalen Brunson and Spencer Dinwiddie hunt the matchups they wanted and isolate. That\'s it. That\'s all Dallas had to do to win Game 3. I hate to be this reckless but, barring something extreme, this series is over. The Jazz are broken. If they can\'t even keep Brunson and Dinwiddie in front of them, what chance do they have against Luka Doncic if he returns? Even if he doesn\'t, what\'s going on with the Jazz right now is deeper than a slump. It\'s a fundamental flaw in design. This era of Jazz basketball is coming to a close. Dallas should be favored in this game. It\'s getting five points instead. The pick: Mavericks +6 Do you want to bet on Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving shooting 8 of 30 from the field again in Game 3? Because that\'s what happened in Game 2, and the total still reached 221 points. If your rebuttal is that Durant probably won\'t shoot 20 free throws again … well … he honestly might! He legitimately got fouled that often in Game 2. It\'s a tactic teams have taken against Durant for years, especially when they switch screens and have smaller defenders on him. The Houston Rockets tried the same tactics in 2018: Do everything possible to keep him from actually getting the ball, and when he does, hack and hope they don\'t call everything. They called everything on the road in Game 2. It stands to reason they will again at home in Game 3. The pick: Over 222.5 Karl-Anthony Towns has just 23 points in the past two games. Perhaps not coincidentally, he also had five fouls in each of those games. Foul trouble obviously affects minutes, which in turn affects production, but this goes deeper. Towns is clearly frustrated by his limited production in this series. It\'s leading to excessive fouling. Expect the Timberwolves to make a point of involving Towns specifically to ensure he doesn\'t let his emotions get the best of him.

Led by LeBron James, the current squad were expected to win their division and challenge for the 2022 NBA title, having won the championship in 2020. However, they lost 49 of their 82 games and failed to make the play-offs. Johnson told BBC Sport the Lakers\' final league position was unacceptable. \"We\'re very disappointed here in Los Angeles. All Laker fans around the world are disappointed,\" said Johnson, who won five NBA titles at the Lakers in the 1980s. \"This is the worst season we probably ever had in Laker history. \"When you have four Hall of Famers, Carmelo Anthony, LeBron James, Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook [there] is no way you should miss the play-offs. So it\'s a disappointing season.\"  Following a below-par season the Lakers sacked Frank Vogel as their head coach. The 48-year-old had spent three years in charge of the franchise and had led them to a title in 2020.   The Lakers are the joint-most successful team in NBA history, having won 17 championships. A record they share with the Boston Celtics.   And Johnson says whoever takes over needs to quickly try to re-establish that winning mentality.   \"We need to get back [to] being focused on winning, to play winning basketball. So hopefully next season, they\'ll bounce back and head in the right direction,\" the 62-year old said.   Although LeBron James - playing his 19th year in the league - had his best season in terms of scoring, averaging 30.3 points per game, the team around him failed to deliver on early season expectations. James, now aged 37, missed 26 games through injury. The teams\' second best player, Anthony Davis, also faced lengthy periods on the sidelines. Acquired in the summer from the Washington Wizards, Russell Westbrook failed to have the impact many expected the former league Most Valuable Player (MVP) would have. Considered by many to be one of basketball\'s greatest players, Johnson was speaking as he launched his new Apple TV documentary series, They Call Me Magic. The four-part series focuses on his rise from high-school talent to college champion and NBA superstar. It features appearances from basketball great Michael Jordan, former Lakers coach Pat Riley and former US president Barack Obama. Johnson explained he felt the timing was right to tell his story to a whole new generation. \"After Michael Jordan The Last Dance [TV documentary], people started calling me and saying, \'We want to see your doc, we want to see the story about your life\'. \"And so that\'s how it happened. We wanted to capture those great moments, high, high moments of my life, but also the low moments as well,\" Johnson said. There is a statue of Johnson outside the Los Angeles Lakers home stadium. An icon of the city, his career was cut short after he was diagnosed with HIV in 1991. After publicly announcing he had the virus, he became a spokesperson for it, helping to raise awareness and combat misconceptions about how it can be contracted. \"[It was a] tough time when I announced I had HIV,\" he said. \"And here I am living 30 years later, which I thought would never happen when we first announced it.\"  Johnson made a return to basketball twice after his diagnosis. But the tenures with the Lakers were short-lived because of stigma surrounding HIV at the time and the reaction from players in the league.  \"I mean, these are, they were tough moments, and emotional moments. And then when you start thinking about them again, you get emotional, right? \"But it\'s a part of life, and my journey.\"  Johnson rekindled his love affair with the Lakers when he joined their management team in 2017. Although he vacated his role as Lakers\' president of basketball operations in April 2019. Now a successful businessman and entrepreneur, he says he wants his legacy to be remembered for the work he did on and off the court.', '20 April 202220 April 2022'),

WBC and Ring Magazine champion Tyson Fury will look to strengthen his status as the best fighter in the division. Challenger Dillian Whyte will aim to shock the boxing world.  Hype for the clash has only really amped up over the past few days with Whyte - up until fight week - not participating in news conferences or promotional events.  The 34-year-old was aggrieved by his share of the purse, but the topic of who is earning what and the politics involved can now be put to bed, with the focus firmly on who will come out top.  Fury has won 31 bouts, with 22 knockouts, and drawn one as a professional. Whyte has won 28, with 19 stoppages, but has twice tasted defeat.  In a true tussle of the boxer versus the brawler, BBC Sport previews the blockbuster bout by speaking to both fighters, former heavyweight champions David Haye and Joseph Parker and boxing trainer Dave Coldwell.  Joe Bugner\'s narrow victory over the popular Henry Cooper over 15 gruelling rounds at Wembley Arena in 1971 was watched by millions on terrestrial television, while 26,000 fans in Cardiff witnessed champion Lennox Lewis knock out national treasure Frank Bruno in 1993.  Both bouts are solid examples of all-British heavyweight clashes which captured the imagination of the general public but, on numbers alone, Fury-Whyte can stake its claim as the biggest.  A post-war European record of 94,000 fans will fill out Wembley Stadium, while the purse bids are the highest in boxing with Queensbury promoter Frank Warren successfully bidding $41m (Â£30.6m) to host the fight.  \"I\'m ready to rock and roll,\" Whyte said at Thursday\'s media conference. \"It means everything to fight in my own country and for the world title.\"  Fury, 33, added: \"It speaks for itself. It\'s the highest selling British fight in the history of our sport.\"  Coldwell, who has been in Whyte\'s corner in the past, believes Fury-Whyte is a bigger draw than Lewis-Bruno.   \"Bruno was a big hero back then, like Tyson Fury is now,\" he says. \"But the Brits hadn\'t yet taken to Lewis at the time of that fight.\" Whyte\'s self-imposed silence had impacted the promotion of the fight. He did not appear at last month\'s media conference which enabled Fury - ever the showman - to entertain reporters alone.   The challenger meanwhile kept a low profile while training out in Portugal. He landed in London on Monday and attended the pre-fight media conference on Wednesday.  After years of social media back and forth, it was expected that tempers may flare but Fury and Whyte, surprisingly, shared a great deal of mutual respect.  \"He\'s a decent bloke. A decent fella and he\'s got good morals,\" Fury said. \"I\'m not going to sit here and slate the fella because I\'ve got nothing to slate him on.\"  Whyte also did not dwell on any previous bad blood, saying: \"He understands warrior code. He treated me with respect and I treated him with respect.\" The fight has been somewhat overshadowed by Fury\'s links to Daniel Kinahan, who last week was among seven people hit with worldwide financial sanctions by the United States. Fury had previously been advised by Kinahan but at the public workout insisted he has \"absolutely zero\" involvement with the Irishman, either in a business or advisory role and dismissed suggestions it has distracted his preparations.  \"In my life I\'ve got a massive man trying to punch my face in this week and I\'ve got to deal with that so anything else is out of my control and nothing to do with me at all,\" Fury said.  Whyte is a clear underdog but, as the boxing cliche goes, it only takes one punch in heavyweight boxing; and Whyte\'s relentless style and vicious hooks pose danger to any opponent.  \"He\'s a good fighter,\" Fury says. \"A good strong solid man. He\'s big, small, strong, tough, game. He has good punch with good power, he\'s knocked out a lot of men.\"  While Fury is undefeated in 32 bouts, Whyte lost to Anthony Joshua in 2015 and was then knocked out by a 40-year-old Alexander Povetkin in August 2020, only to avenge his defeat by the Russian seven months later.   But Haye - a former two-weight world champion - says past results have little relevance in heavyweight boxing, referencing Lewis\' losses to Oliver McCall and Hasim Rahman and Joshua\'s shock defeat by Andy Ruiz Jr in 2019.  \"Anything can happen in heavyweight boxing and time to time an anomaly happens,\" he says. \"The way that Dillian has the best opportunity of winning is to get in close and turn it into a slugfest. I think he stops Fury on his feet late doors at some stage\". Parker - who was dropped twice before losing on points to Whyte in 2018 - is acutely aware of how tough \'The Body Snatcher\' is.  \"He has power in both hands and will always come game and ready,\" the New Zealand heavyweight says. \"We haven\'t seen much of him so no-one knows what to expect in terms of approach and what kind of shape he\'s in.\"  Outside of the ring, Fury\'s comeback story from mental health struggles and weight gain has been well documented. Inside the squared circle, The Gypsy King is considered by many to be one of the most skilful and elusive heavyweight boxers of his generation.  Fury will fight in the United Kingdom for the first time since 2018, with his past five bouts - including the trilogy with Deontay Wilder - taking place in the United States.  Parker says although the champion has become a global superstar in recent years, he is not taking this fight lightly.  \"I don\'t think there\'s any complacency in Team Fury or Tyson himself,\" he says. \"They\'ve put in the best work they can for the fight. \"But I believe Tyson is going to repeatedly hit him with the jab and knock him out between rounds five and nine.\"  Fury, modestly and perhaps a little tongue-in-cheek, plays down his own credentials.  \"I\'ve been bounced off the canvas more times than a bouncy ball,\" he says. \"I\'m not this untouchable boxer that everything thinks I might be. I\'m just a normal boxing guy who has got lucky 32 times before.\"  Haye - who was set to face Fury in 2013 before withdrawing through injury - has been criticised by Fury\'s father for once again predicting a loss for the champion.  John Fury claims Haye would \"pick Santa Claus\" over his son and has demanded he be removed from the TV broadcast team.  In response to those comments, Haye says: \"Just like he\'d back his son against King Kong. I just say it like I see it.  \"I thought Wladimir Klitschko was going to beat him in 2015, just like everyone did and got it wrong, and I thought Wilder all three times had the ability to knock him out, which he nearly did.\" A victory for Whyte would not only stun the boxing world, but he will announce himself as one of the biggest draws in heavyweight boxing. With a win bonus on offer and as a free agent not tied to any promoter, it will catapult him into international boxing stardom.   While Coldwell is edging towards a Fury victory, he says the hard yards Whyte has put in over the years could now pay off.  \"He\'s chased that WBC mandatory position and while he\'s been mandatory for years he\'s taken some great fights that have added to his experience, boxing knowledge and ring general-ship,\" Coldwell adds.  Fellow Briton Joshua is expected to rematch WBA, WBO and IBF champion Oleksandr Usyk this summer and both Haye and Parker would like to see the winner of Fury-Whyte challenge for the undisputed clash.  \"It has to be the undisputed next,\" Parker says. Haye adds: \"I\'m hoping Anthony Joshua claims those belts back and then we will have, without doubt, the biggest all-British title fight of all time.\" But win, lose or draw, Fury says his plans to retire from the sport following this fight and will not be lured in by the prospect of capturing all of the belts.  \"This is it. In the capital city. It\'s the pinnacle of it all,\" Fury says.  \"There\'s no amount of money or belts I haven\'t already won or I haven\'t already got that will bring me back.\"', '22 April 202222 April 2022'),

Butler, 33, took the belt with scores of 116-112, 118-110 and 117-111 at the M&S Bank Arena. \"I had 48 hours to get a game plan together,\" said Butler. The WBO could decide to upgrade Butler\'s title to full world championship status, which would make him a two-time world champion after he held the IBF belt in 2014. \"It\'s unbelievable. What a feeling. I\'ve waited a long time to become a two-time world champion,\" he said. Butler was first scheduled to meet Casimero in Dubai in December 2021, but the fight fell through when Casimero failed to make weight. They were then due to meet on Friday, but Casimero breached British Boxing Board of Control rules by using a sauna to lose weight in close proximity to a fight. Butler made a bright start against Sultan, producing a great variety of punches and finding the target with combinations as Sultan struggled to land anything substantial. Sultan started the sixth well, but Butler, utilising fine footwork and solid boxing skills, kept making his opponent lunge in and miss. Sultan had some success at the end of the eighth and had his best round in the ninth, but could not build on that as Butler regained control to secure a dominant victory.

The two Britons will fight in front of 94,000 fans - a post-war British record - with Fury making a second defence of the title he won against Deontay Wilder in February 2020. Fury\'s drop in weight from the final bout in the Wilder trilogy in October gives a slight indication as to how he may approach the fight.  Against Wilder, Fury went toe-to-toe with the big-punching American. Weighing in lighter suggests Fury may revert back to fighting at range and using his quick feet and movement to outbox Whyte. Whyte, dressed in all black, took to the stage first and was dealt a chorus of boos by the Fury-friendly crowd at BoxPark in Wembley. The 34-year-old\'s self-imposed media silence before the fight left many wondering what shape he would come in, but Whyte looked in good condition and is 6lb heavier than when he knocked out Alexander Povetkin in March 2021. Fury then made his way to the scales. Wearing a white, blue and red tracksuit, the \'Gypsy King\' paraded his WBC belt to a pumped-up crowd. The fighters have shared several social media spats over the years but, just as it was at Wednesday\'s media conference, there was a jovial atmosphere with no signs of any bad blood. They jokingly tickled each other, shook hands and then swapped baseball caps. Fury and Whyte almost resembled a double act and gave in the demands of an audience wanting an encore when they returned to the stage. They danced in unison to some music, throwing their hands in the air while bouncing on the spot.  On Wednesday Fury and Whyte calmed down their respective entourages when matters got heated between the two teams. At the weigh-in, Team Fury and Team Whyte reconciled as the fighters\' brothers embraced on stage. All media commitments and obligatory fight week events are done.

Britain\'s Anthony Joshua is expected to fight Ukraine\'s Oleksandr Usyk in a rematch this summer in a bid to reclaim the WBA, IBF and WBO belts he lost in September. The winner of Fury-Whyte will could then face Joshua or Usyk for an undisputed clash later this year.

Whyte is challenging for a world title for the first time, having won 28 bouts, with 19 stoppages.

The Spirit of Britain had been detained by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA). It has been conducting trial sails up and down the English coast between Dover and New Romney, a marine traffic website has shown.  Safety fears were raised after P&O replaced nearly 800 seafarers with cheaper agency staff last month. The marine traffic website, which shows the live positions of ships, reports the ferry\'s destinations as \"TRIALS\".  P&O tweeted on Saturday morning that its services remain suspended. The MCA previously said the Spirit of Britain \"has been released from detention and can commence operations when P&O Ferries are ready\". The firm suspended most of its sailings but reportedly only expected the disruption to last up to 10 days. However inspections prevented a number of ferries from operating, which contributed to major travel disruption near Dover in the run-up to, and during the, Easter holidays. When the Spirit of Britain was detained earlier this month, P&O Ferries were told to fix a number of safety issues before a second inspection by the MCA. P&O operates four ferries across the English Channel between Dover and Calais.  The Pride of Kent remains under the detention of the MCA and two other P&O ferries on this route have yet to be inspected.  The removal of these four P&O ferries from service had a substantial impact on passenger and freight traffic, affecting both holidays and trade.  The Easter holidays created a major bottleneck, as thousands of lorries queued to cross the channel alongside families going on holiday in Europe.

He spoke to the BBC after France issued an international warrant for his arrest, citing allegedly suspect payments. Mr Ghosn said he was \"expecting\" the move though he was \"surprised at the timing\". Mr Ghosn faced charges of financial misconduct when he fled Japan in 2019. The former head of Nissan, once one of the most powerful figures in the car industry, is currently unable to leave Lebanon, as he is the subject of an Interpol Red Notice issued by Japan. He told the BBC: \"I want to stand trial because that\'s the only way I can get rid of the Red Notice which today forbids me from leaving Lebanon.\" He said he wanted a trial in Lebanon on the charges brought against him in Japan, and any that emerge from the French investigation -  and was \"totally confident\" he could prove his innocence. Prosecutors in France are investigating claims that Mr Ghosn funnelled millions of euros from Renault through Suhail Bahwan Automobiles. According to reports first published in the Wall Street Journal, he used the money for personal purchases including that of a 120-foot yacht. An investigating magistrate in France has now issued five international arrest warrants against Mr Ghosn and four people linked to a car distributor in Oman. Mr Ghosn told the BBC on Friday: \"There was not one euro [from Nissan or Renault] that ended up benefitting me directly or indirectly\". He denied he was a fugitive from justice - and repeated previous claims he had left Japan because he would not have had a fair trial there.  Mr Ghosn said the charges against him were part of a conspiracy to derail his plans for a full merger between Renault and Nissan. Since his escape, Carlos Ghosn has repeatedly claimed that the charges against him in Japan were baseless.  They were, he maintains, part of a conspiracy, designed to prevent him from orchestrating a merger between Nissan and its French partner Renault. But for several years a separate investigation has been quietly taking place in France. An investigating magistrate recently questioned Mr Ghosn at length in Beirut. The decision to issue an international arrest warrant suggests the French side believes there is a genuine case to answer at least. Mr Ghosn has said he would be happy to stand trial in France to clear his name, and his lawyers seem confident that would happen. But there\'s a problem. The former executive is banned from leaving Lebanon because he is still subject to an extradition request from Japan, even though that request is highly unlikely to be granted. For the moment, he remains in a legal limbo. Mr Ghosn once ran the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance, one of the biggest car-making groups in the world. He was arrested in Japan in late 2018, and faced a number of charges, including claims he deliberately mis-reported his earnings and used company money to fund his own lifestyle. He denied any wrongdoing. He has previously spoken of his dramatic escape from Japan, which involved disguising himself to go unnoticed through the streets of Tokyo, being hidden in a large music equipment box and fleeing to his native Lebanon as he awaited trial.  Mr Ghosn, who holds Brazilian, Lebanese and French passports, cannot be extradited to France from Beirut, although he confirmed to the BBC that he has been questioned as part of the investigation. He said he thought France had issued the arrest warrant because under its law the investigation could not be closed unless he was in French territory. \"So in a certain way we were expecting something like this to happen,\" he said. \"What was surprising was the timing...and also that we knew about it through an American newspaper...without me being officially alerted.\" Earlier, his lawyer, Jean Tamalet at King & Spalding, told the BBC: \"We believe this move is the only technical resort they found to be able in the future to try the case in a court of law.\" Warrants were also issued against the current owners and former directors of the car distributor, Suhail Bahwan Automobiles.

Tesco is allowing three items per customer. Waitrose and Morrisons have limited shoppers to two items each.

The British Retail Consortium says the restrictions are a temporary measure \"to ensure availability for everyone.\"  Olive, rapeseed and sunflower oils are included in the limits being put in place by some supermarkets, both in-store and online. Iceland have not yet commented on pictures posted on social media of signs that have appeared in its stores limiting sales of two-litre and five-litre bottles of sunflower oil to one per customer.  Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Waitrose said: \"We are closely monitoring the situation and working with our suppliers to ensure customers continue to have a choice of cooking oils.\" Grocery expert Ged Futter says shoppers can be reassured that there are plenty of alternatives when it comes to cooking oils. \"We are used to an abundance of varieties, what we may see is that they become more limited,\" he says.

It has tracked changes in the average cost of sunflower oil across major retailers including Tesco, Sainsbury\'s, Asda, Morrisons, Aldi and Lidl. Its data suggests that a one-litre bottle of own-brand sunflower oil has gone up by an average of 12p to £1.26 since January 2022 - an increase of more than 10%.  For a five-litre bottle, the increase was 38p or 6%. There had been no change in the average price of a one-litre of own-brand organic sunflower oil, which stood at £3.10.  UK food manufacturers that use sunflower oil as an ingredient in their products, such as crisps and oven chips, have also reported concerns over supplies.

Alan Barratt, 62, and Susan Dalton, 66, tricked people into transferring savings to schemes supposedly investing in property or \"truffle trees\". One victim told the BBC that the fraudsters had wanted to secure their own pension \"by taking mine instead\". Barratt and Dalton admitted fraud based on their roles as pension trustees. More than £13m of pension savings were transferred, and the pair forwarded most of the money to the mastermind of the criminal enterprise, David Austin, from Guildford in Surrey. A previous case heard evidence that he used it to live a life of luxury including ski holidays and trips to Dubai. It was funnelled offshore and funded his businesses, was used to pay others involved in the operation, and enriched himself and family members. He killed himself in 2019, before the criminal investigation was completed.  At Southwark Crown Court on Friday, Barratt was jailed for five years and seven months while Dalton was jailed for four years and eight months. Both stood and looked straight ahead in the dock as the sentences were handed down.  Passing sentence, Judge Gregory Perrins said the pair caused \"such misery to so many people\", with victims suffering mental health problems and some even attempting suicide. \"Each account that I have read is a story of a life ruined by your actions and you should both be ashamed,\" he said. Former mineworker Stephen O\'Reilly was among their victims, lost more than £100,000, and now has to work in a bookmakers to pay his bills. \"My pension has gone. I am going to have to work for the rest of my life,\" the 62-year-old said. He answered an advert for a free pension review 10 years ago, in the hope he could release some funds to renovate and sell homes in Spain. \"My kids are grown up but I wanted to make some money to leave to them,\" he told the BBC. The supposed review led to a call from Dalton after which he transferred £114,000 in pension savings. He was given a small commission, which was actually part of his own pension, and told some of the money would be invested in overseas property. He expected to receive a lump sum at the age of 55, and had even ordered a new car in anticipation. The money never arrived and when he enquired, he discovered he had been the victim of a scam. Previously, his mineworker\'s pension from 14 years working underground had been inappropriately transferred and he received compensation. This time, the money had disappeared entirely. \"It is a lesson learnt, and now I can only hope some other people will learn from my lesson,\" he said. Pauline Padden had received a text about a pension review when she was 50, and eventually transferred £45,000 - thinking she was investing in property in holiday resorts in the Caribbean. She became suspicious when she did not receive any paperwork, and was then notified that she had been the victim of a scam. \"If that money had been properly invested, it would have meant I could retire when I wanted to retire,\" said Mrs Padden, 58, who has been a critical care nurse for 40 years. \"Now that has been completely taken from me. It has gone forever. I\'m not sure I will ever see that money again - I doubt it.\" She said the experience had left her anxious and she finds it hard to trust people. Her family are worried about her. \"I felt stupid. I felt duped. That is not a nice feeling to have,\" she said, urging others to be wary of similar offers. While she faces many more years working in the stressful surroundings of the NHS, she describes those behind the scam as \"greedy\" and hopes their conviction will be a deterrent to others. \"They are not much different in age than me. They were looking for their own pension pot, and decided to take mine instead - and that of many people as well as me,\" she said. \"I was just trying to secure a future so I wouldn\'t have to depend on the state, but they have just happily and willingly stolen that money off me. They knew when they were taking it. They knew, and they just took it anyway.\" Barratt, Dalton, and Austin were among those who ran 10 dishonest pension schemes. In 2018, Austin and Barratt were ordered to repay £7.7m and Austin and Dalton £5.9m to those who had lost out. However, none of the victims have yet to receive a penny of the money they should have been refunded. The High Court ruling, reported by the BBC at the time, was a legal first as it came after an application from The Pensions Regulator, which had been granted new powers. One victim in that case said he and his wife were assured their pensions would be invested in low-risk investments. They were then sent details of a firm producing so-called truffle trees in the West Country. Criminal investigations followed the civil proceedings, which culminated in Friday\'s sentencing. Barratt, of Burnham Road, Althorne, Essex, and Dalton, 66, of Brookdale, Rochdale, Lancashire, both admitted charges of fraud by abuse of position in breach of the Fraud Act 2006 arising from their roles as trustees of pension schemes. In addition to their jail terms, both have been banned from being directors of companies for eight years. A confiscation hearing, to recover what might remain of the profits of the scam, is set to take place in November. On Friday, Southwark Crown Court heard that Barratt, an \"unsophisticated\" former photocopier salesman, trusted Austin and did not want to \"rock the boat\" because he was paid more than he had ever been paid before. Initially, he believed what he was doing was lawful, the court heard.     In mitigation for Dalton, the court heard that she \"turned a blind eye\" to the fraud. In a statement read in court, she said she apologised to victims and punished herself every single day for her part in the fraud.  Pensions minister Guy Opperman said he welcomed the sentence and thanked the Pensions Regulator \"for its role in bringing the perpetrators to justice\". Lead lawyer for the regulator, Carl Dowling, branded the scam \"despicable\", adding the sentence sent \"a clear message\". \"Pension scams ruin lives.

Online sales fell sharply as people cut down on non-essential spending, the Office for National Statistics said. Fuel sales also dropped as people cut travel amid record petrol and diesel prices. However, overall retail sales were still above pre-Covid levels, the ONS said. Retail sales fell by an unexpected 1.4% in the month, and February\'s sales figures were also revised down. Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics, said \"Online sales were hit particularly hard due to lower levels of discretionary spending. \"Fuel sales also fell substantially, with evidence suggesting some people reduced non-essential journeys, following record high petrol prices, while food sales continued to fall, dropping for the fifth consecutive month.\" The cost of living crisis is being driven by surges in fuel, energy and food prices, with inflation running at 7% - its highest rate for 30 years. Energy and fuel prices had been rising even before Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine as economies started to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, and the conflict has pushed up prices further. Bethany Beckett, UK economist for Capital Economics, said inflation was set to keep rising and \"there\'s a real risk of an outright fall in consumer spending in the coming quarters\". The biggest contribution to the March retail sales slide came from the drop in online sales, which have been falling from pandemic highs after coronavirus restrictions eased. \"The sharp decline in sales in March suggests that households are already paring back spending to cope with higher costs for food and fuel,\" said Ms Beckett. \"That is only likely to worsen in the coming months as the cost of living crisis intensifies. After all, the March data predated April\'s huge 54% rise in utility bills which will have hit household budgets hard.\" Separately, a survey by GfK suggested that UK consumer confidence in April dropped to its second-lowest level in 50 years due to people\'s weakening confidence in the economy and in their personal finances. Consumer confidence was at its lowest ebb since July 2008, which was during the severe worldwide economic crisis, the market research firm said. by Ramzan Karmali, BBC business correspondent The bigger-than-expected fall in retail sales last month was largely down to the current cost of living crisis - that\'s according to ONS officials.  Online sales of non-essential items fell again, and the data suggests that record high petrol prices are having a major impact with a cut in non-essential journeys. More significantly perhaps is the fact food sales have been falling since last November, which is a sign that consumers are paring back their spending to cope with higher costs. Economists believe the situation will only become more acute as March\'s data came before April\'s 54% hike in gas and electricity bills. They also point to falling consumer confidence - the survey for this in April slumped to its lowest level in 14 years. Meanwhile, a survey of businesses suggested a slowdown in private sector growth in April. The UK\'s dominant services sector saw growth slow sharply, the S&P Global/CIPS composite Purchasing Managers\' Index indicated. Although manufacturing growth picked up slightly after a five-month low in March, new manufacturing orders from abroad fell by the most since June 2020 as orders from Europe fell back. Firms also said export orders were hit by Brexit, recent congestion in UK ports and sanctions on Russia, the survey found. There was also a sharp rise in company insolvencies in March, according to official data. The number of firms going bust rose to 2,114 in March, more than double the number in March 2021, and a third higher than pre-pandemic figures. The Bank of England has been raising interest rates to try to cool inflation, and its key rate currently stands at 0.75%. Its governor, Andrew Bailey, said on Thursday that the Bank was walking a tight line between dealing with inflation and avoiding recession. Bank of England monetary policymaker Catherine Mann said that interest rates would probably have to go up \"a little bit\" further. Asked about the risk of so-called \"stagflation\", which is a combination of slow growth and high inflation, Ms Mann said \"in some senses, we could say we\'re already there\" because of the jump in energy prices and slowing retail sales. \"But I think that, you know, it\'s premature to kind of hearken back to the 1980s or the 1970s, in the US context in particular, and use that vocabulary,\" she said.

The maker of KitKats and Nesquik cereal increased prices by more than 5% in the first three months of the year.  The price rise helped Nestle to report sales growth of 7.6% in the period. As costs rise, Nestle boss Mark Schneider said \"further pricing and mitigating actions over the course of the year\" will be required. \"We stepped up pricing in a responsible manner and saw sustained consumer demand,\" Mr Schneider added.  Food prices worldwide are at their highest since records began 60 years ago, according to the UN Food price index.  In the UK, the cost of living is rising at its fastest pace for 30 years as energy, fuel and food prices continue to soar and increase the squeeze on household budgets.  Analysts said Nestle\'s price rise of 5.2% helped its sales to increase by more than expected.   \"Hiking prices to keep things moving in the right direction in the wake of input cost inflation certainly won\'t be a course of action management want to have to take,\" said Matt Britzman, an analyst at  Hargreaves Lansdown.  \"But nonetheless, it\'s the position Nestle finds itself in and doesn\'t look likely to go away anytime soon,\" he added.

Adam Scorer, boss of fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, called for action before it was too late. The Resolution think tank, said one solution could be a social tariff, with wealthier customers paying more to fund discounted rates for those struggling. Big energy firms have warned hundreds of thousands may struggle to pay bills. At least 40% of energy giant E.ON\'s customers will go into fuel poverty as prices rise this year, the company\'s chief executive told the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee on Tuesday, while the head of Scottish Power said this autumn would be \"horrific\" for poor customers. The price cap is set to be increased again in October, potentially pushing an average annual bill up to £2,600, one analyst has told the BBC. To date, the government has said it will offer extra relief of £150 in April via the council tax system in England, and in October customers in England, Scotland and Wales will receive a £200 rebate on their energy bills. They will have to repay this at £40 a year for five years, starting in April 2023. The warm house discount scheme is also being expanded to cover three million households. It offers low income households a one-off annual discount on their electricity bill, and was worth £140 in 2021-22. \"The scale of this problem is beyond what the energy companies can do. This is a catastrophe for many households on the lowest income. \"It means the government has another chance to get ahead of the next phase of this crisis. It has spurned the ones it has had before,\" Adam Scorer, chief executive of National Energy Action, told Radio 4\'s Today Programme. Torsten Bell, whose think tank Resolution Foundation focuses on those on lower incomes, said energy bosses were right to focus people on \"the catastrophe coming this autumn\".  \"They\'re right to say we aren\'t doing enough,\" he added. Mr Bell said a social tariff was \"definitely worth exploring\", in part because it would target money at those on the lowest incomes. Until 2011, energy companies offered cheaper packages to customers that were in fuel poverty, meaning that 10% or more of their income was spent on gas and electricity. They also offered the tariffs, which often matched the cheapest deal available on the market, to customers over 60 years old, on means-tested benefits, or on a low income.  But Mr Bell cautioned that social tariffs also presented their own problems.  He pointed to the low take up of similar packages for broadband internet, which have so far only been adopted by 1-2% of Universal Credit claimants, while adding that raising bills even further for middle and top earners was \"unlikely to be a good idea\" in the short term. \"And in the longer term, the government is already looking at using energy bills to pay for some of the energy infrastructure that we need. \"The big challenge with this as an approach is do we really want to use energy bills to pay for help for poorer households,\" he added. Mr Bell said the benefits system was a better alternative to help those most in need. The price of fuel, food and energy in the UK has rocketed this year, with inflation rising at its fastest rate in 30 years. Wera Hobhouse MP, Liberal Democrat energy spokesperson, said \"it\'s now or never for the government to step in for millions of families up and down the country feeling the pinch from the worst cost of living crisis in a generation.\" This was echoed by Ed Miliband MP, Labour\'s shadow secretary of state of climate change and net zero, who said it was \"shameful that Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak are refusing to support the British people facing a cost of living crisis.\"  Boss of failed firm Bulb defends £250,000 salary How high could my energy bills go?

Questions over the PM\'s position have been reignited this week after MPs backed a Commons inquiry into whether he has misled them. A senior Tory predicted it is \"a matter of when not if\" the PM now faces a no confidence vote from his own MPs. But Mr Johnson insisted he would still be in office this autumn. Asked during a trip to India whether he would still be in post by his October target for a trade deal with the country, he replied: \"Yes\". And he sought to play down the partygate row, saying voters wanted the government to \"focus on the issues on which we were elected\". Mr Johnson is facing a future investigation by the Commons privileges committee, after MPs gave the go-ahead on Thursday.  No 10 initially tried to delay a vote on approving the inquiry, but later backed down in the face of unease among Tory backbenchers. The committee will determine whether he misled MPs by telling them Covid rules were followed in No 10 - a charge regarded as a resigning matter under the ministerial rulebook. Last week, Mr Johnson, his wife Carrie and the Chancellor Rishi Sunak were fined by the police for breaching lockdown rules by attending a gathering to celebrate his birthday in June 2020. The PM is known to have attended at least two more of the 12 events being investigated by Met police, meaning he could be fined again. The fine has led to renewed calls for Mr Johnson to resign - and increasing speculation he could face a leadership challenge from within his party if May\'s local elections go badly for the Tories. This video can not be played Tory peer and polling expert Lord Hayward said he expected Mr Johnson to eventually face a leadership challenge. He warned the various investigations into the PM\'s conduct could prove a \"death by a thousand cuts\" - and figures in the party wanted the question over his position to be resolved.  \"We are moving to a position, despite what the prime minister says, [where] Tory MPs, Tory associations, Tory councillors, do not want an even more protracted process,\" he added. \"We\'ve had it basically since before Christmas now, and I expect that were will be some form of contest for leadership at some stage.\" Hindsight may have helped, but some Conservative MPs claim Thursday\'s chaotic events in Parliament could\'ve been predicted.  They point back to Tuesday when relatively few Tory backbenchers stood up to defend Boris Johnson after his statement about being fined.  Something has shifted according to one critic of the prime minister, who claimed more and more of their colleagues were reluctant to back him in public.  Boris Johnson still has plenty of supporters and many are giving him the benefit of the doubt until after the police investigation and Sue Gray report.  The patience of some others is wearing thin, but there is no sign of any immediate co-ordinated move to challenge the PM\'s position.  Nevertheless, Boris Johnson will return from his trip to India having lost the support of more of his MPs and facing a third investigation into his conduct.  Earlier, Tory MP Tobias Ellwood said Conservative MPs were \"deeply troubled\" about the \"long-term damage to the party\'s brand\" caused by the partygate saga. Also predicting Mr Johnson would face a vote of no confidence, the defence committee chair accused No 10 of lacking \"discipline, focus and leadership\". Labour shadow minister Peter Kyle said Mr Johnson was a \"dead man walking\" who could no longer manage the country or his own party.  But Northern Ireland Minister Conor Burns, a longtime ally of the PM, dismissed criticism from Conservative MPs, saying some of his colleagues had never supported the prime minister. \"If the prime minister stepped off Westminster Bridge and walked down the Thames on top of water they would say it was because he couldn\'t swim,\" he said. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon - who was herself spoken to by police after being filmed breaching Scotland\'s face mask rules - said Mr Johnson was \"unfit for office\" and predicted he would be forced out. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the Partygate issue was \"a huge distraction for Boris Johnson and the government, and this is why he should have resigned a long time ago.\" The Commons privileges committee will determine whether the PM committed a \"contempt\" of Parliament by knowingly misleading MPs. It is made up of seven MPs - two from Labour (Yvonne Fovargue and Chris Bryant), one SNP (Allan Dorans) and four Conservatives (Andy Carter, Alberto Costa, Laura Farris and Sir Bernard Jenkin). Mr Bryant, who chairs the committee, has stepped back from the investigation as he had already commented publicly on the matter. It is understood that Labour is considering options within the party to replace him during the investigation. If the committee finds Mr Johnson did mislead Parliament, they can recommend a sanction which could include suspension from Parliament or ordering him to apologise.  The whole House of Commons would then have to sign off on any punishment.', '1 day ago'),

The prime minister also said there was a \"realistic possibility\" the Russian bombardment would continue until the end of next year. Mr Johnson added the UK was looking at sending tanks to support Poland as it supplies Ukraine with heavy weaponry. The prime minister made the embassy announcement at a news conference in Delhi, where he has been holding talks with Indian leader Narendra Modi.  It comes after Russia withdrew forces from around Kyiv when it failed to seize the capital, and launched an assault on the eastern Donbas region. Mr Johnson visited Kyiv earlier this month to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky, following a pledge to give £100m worth of weapons to Ukraine.  Taking questions from reporters, the prime minister said intelligence assessments that the Russian assault could continue to the end of next year, and end with a Russian victory, were plausible. He said Russian President Vladimir Putin has \"a huge army\" but \"he has a very difficult political position because he\'s made a catastrophic blunder\". Mr Johnson said: \"The only option he now has, really, is to continue to try to use his appalling, grinding approach driven by artillery, trying to grind the Ukrainians down. \"I think no matter what military superiority Vladimir Putin may be able to bring to bear in the next few months, and I agree it could be a long period, he will not be able to conquer the spirit of the Ukrainian people.\" The prime minister said he was looking at what the UK could do to \"backfill\" weapons in countries, such as Poland, \"who may want to send heavier weaponry to help defend the Ukrainians\".  \"We\'re looking at sending tanks to Poland to help them, as they send some of their T-72s [tanks] to Ukraine and other steps like that,\" Mr Johnson said.  Sending British main battle tanks to Poland, if confirmed, would be a very significant move. As one senior British Army officer put it, it raises the UK\'s commitment to Ukraine by a further notch but also increases the chances of Britain - and Nato - eventually becoming co-belligerents in this conflict.  The tanks, which the Ministry of Defence says would be Challenger 2 main battle tanks, would be intended to \"backfill\" for Poland\'s T72 tanks, which it is sending directly to Ukraine. There are no plans to send British tanks or crews into action in Ukraine.  Until very recently Nato countries have been reluctant to supply heavy weaponry to the Ukrainians for fear of antagonising President Putin and risking an all-out European war that puts Nato forces into direct conflict with Russia.  But with each reported Russian atrocity that is revealed, notably in Bucha, these Western inhibitions have melted away.  Poland is sending tanks, Slovakia has sent its S300 air defence missiles and the US is sending powerful, long-range 155mm artillery.  For Ukraine\'s army, outnumbered and outgunned in the eastern Donbas region, such help cannot come quickly enough.  But President Putin has made no secret of his irritation at Nato\'s assistance to his enemy and he used this week\'s test-launch of a nuclear-capable missile to remind the West of Russia\'s massive arsenal of strategic nuclear weapons. In the long term, Mr Johnson said he believed Western nations would respond to demands from Ukraine to guarantee the country\'s security against future attacks. He said this would not replicate the Article 5 guarantee for Nato members - in which an attack on one country is treated as an attack on all members. But instead, Western allies would offer pledges to provide weaponry, training and intelligence-sharing, the prime minister said. \"I hope it will enable the Ukrainians to offer deterrents by denial and to make sure their territory is so fortified as to be impregnable in the future to further attack from Russia,\" he said. \"Deterrence by denial\" is a term in military thinking which means seeking to put off an aggressor by making their attack infeasible or unlikely to succeed, rather than through the threat of retaliation.

Ahead of fresh negotiations next week, he said a deal could take UK-India trade to \"a whole new level\". Mr Johnson has previously signalled his target covers reaching an agreement in principle, not signing a full deal. Experts say any agreement with India this year is likely to be a precursor to a full agreement, with talks still at a relatively early stage.  And Mr Johnson warned there would be \"tough asks\" from both sides. The meeting between the two leaders in India\'s capital came on the final day of Mr Johnson\'s two-day trip to the country, which has been delayed by Covid. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Johnson said India was \"an incredible rising power in Asia\" and deepening trade was a priority.  In a signal that he could be flexible over an Indian demand for looser immigration rules for its nationals as part of a deal, Mr Johnson said Indian skills could help sectors such as IT. \"I\'m not going to be dogmatic in refusing people with skill and talent in coming to the UK,\" he added. \"All I would say is we need to control it\". Britain is buying much more from India than it sells to India.  That\'s because India tends to put up high trade barriers such as taxes on UK exports, known as tariffs. Foreign cars attract tariffs of up to 100%, for example.  As a result, the UK currently sells less to India, with its vast population, than it does to Belgium. And it\'s getting worse: last year, the UK sold £4.7bn worth of goods to India and bought £8.4bn - that\'s the biggest gap between the UK and India\'s exports and imports that there\'s ever been.  If you include services, the gap is even bigger. The top five goods imported from India were clothing, medicine, fabrics, industrial machinery and electrical goods, with metals and power generators going in the other direction.

The Financial Times reported that draft legislation could be published in May. The protocol is the Brexit deal that prevents a hard Irish border by keeping Northern Ireland inside the European Union\'s (EU) single market for goods. It creates a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. This is something the EU accepts is causing difficulties for many businesses. Boris Johnson was asked about the newspaper story during a visit to India on Friday. Mr Johnson said the UK would continue talking to the EU to seek reforms to the protocol but \"we don\'t rule out taking further steps if that is necessary\". \"This is something that has been a consistent issue for the UK government and I think it\'s very simple. \"It\'s about the balance of the Good Friday Agreement and because of what is happening, it would be fair to say, that the protocol really does not command the confidence of a large large component of the population in Northern Ireland. \"We have to address that, we have to fix that.\" Asked if that could include new legislation, he replied: \"Of course. That goes without saying.\" Article 16 of the protocol already gives the UK or the EU the right to introduce \"safeguard measures\" if the deal is causing serious difficulties which are liable to persist. But a new UK law would go much further than that, giving UK ministers broad discretion and reduced risk from legal challenge. The EU would be likely to view the move as a serious breach of the deal. The Financial Times suggested the law would, for example, give UK ministers the right to disregard the outcome of a Stormont consent vote on the protocol. Under the terms of the current deal the Stormont Assembly gets to vote every four years on whether the main provisions of the protocol should continue. Reacting to the story, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader, Doug Beattie, said he had \"no trust\" in what the UK government was doing and questioned the timing just two weeks before an election. \"If they\'re serious in this then they\'re going to have to put measures in place to make that sure we can deal with the issues that\'s going to come out at the other end of it. \"If they\'re going to bring forward a Northern Ireland act which deals with this issue then let\'s see it. Let politicians here in Northern Ireland see this and add value to it, as opposed to them just thinking:  \'This is what we should do because we think it\'s right\'.\" Sinn Féin\'s Conor Murphy said the UK government had been taking \"reckless actions\" by \"riding coach and horses through agreements they made in their own interests and not in the interests of the people here\". \"We cannot afford to spend another six or nine months that the British government are going to legislate, upend everything, that we understand in terms of the agreement that they\'ve come to with the European Union, and there needs to be international pressure applied to them.  \"Any action that the British government have taken have been about their own selfish interests, regardless of how reckless they have been. Regardless of how they\'ve broken through agreements, how they\'ve threatened to break international law, and we can\'t live in this type of uncertainty.\" Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader, Colum Eastwood said it was \"the same old story\" from the prime minister. \"He doesn\'t care about Northern Ireland, he cares about himself and his own position and that\'s what anyone engaging with him from the unionist side should understand by now. \"At some point this British government and the European Commission have to come to an agreement. That will not please the DUP because they want to rip everything up. The reality is the protocol is a massive opportunity for our businesses and our economy and we should be grasping it.\" DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the new law is \"just speculation\" at the minute but that he will believe the government when he actually sees such legislation put forward. \"The state opening of parliament and the Queen\'s speech will take place on 10 May and that will give us a clear indication as to whether the government indeed intends to include legislative proposals to remove the protocol,\" he said.  \"Clearly that\'s what we are pushing for and everyone knows our position that we are strongly opposed to the protocol.  \"This is harming every household in Northern Ireland, it is driving up the cost of prices in our supermarkets and impacting on the cost of living crisis.\" Stephen Farry, deputy leader of the Alliance Party, accused the prime minister of \"pandering to voices of extreme unionism in Northern Ireland\". \"We\'ve heard similar rumours before and once again we\'re seeing the threat of unilateral action on the protocol and any such action would be counter productive and self-defeating for the government,\" Mr Farry said.  \"The only way to resolve what are some genuine issues with the protocol are through negotiations between the UK and the European Union, because any changes have to be agreed mutually between the two parties under international law. \"We also have to give certainty and stability to businesses here, that they\'re operating in what is a secure and legal environment, otherwise it places everyone in jeopardy and undermines prospects of investment in Northern Ireland.\"  The protocol was agreed by the UK and the EU in October 2019. A series of so-called \"grace periods\" means it has never been fully implemented. Earlier this month the EU changed its laws to ensure Northern Ireland could continue to import medicines from the rest of the UK.

It would prevent the health service buying equipment worth billions from parts of China where it is claimed forced labour is used in supply chains. The government said it wanted to use the NHS\'s buying power to help \"eradicate modern slavery\". MPs are expected to hold a vote on the measure and pass it next week. Health Secretary Sajid Javid is due to introduce the new law as an amendment to the Health and Social Care Bill on Friday, after coming under cross-party pressure. The amendment says the health secretary must make regulations to \"eradicate\" the use of goods and services in the health service in England that are \"tainted\" by slavery and human trafficking. The change comes after Britain bought billions of pounds of protective health equipment during the Covid pandemic. some of which was allegedly manufactured by forced labour in China. The government revealed in February that the UK had bought £5.8bn worth of lateral flow tests from China. There have particularly been concerns about the use of forced labour in the Xinjiang province of western China. Reports have documented the detention of many thousands of people - mostly the largely Muslim Uyghur minority - in camps the authorities insist are for the re-education of extremists. Details of the new law have still to be worked out but the regulations are expected to set out the steps the NHS should take to assess the risks associated with individual suppliers and the basis on which they should be excluded from any tendering process.  Campaigners say this would effectively create a blacklist of companies banned from providing goods and services to the NHS - including medical equipment, security technology and basic infrastructure. A senior government source said the amendment would help ensure the NHS was not buying or using goods or services involving any kind of slave labour.  \"It\'s absolutely right that we use the NHS - a huge procurer of all sorts of goods and services - to help eradicate modern slavery around the world,\" the source said. Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran said: \"\"This is long overdue. It should not have taken a pandemic to shine a light on the hugely concerning links between supply chains involving forced labour - including those in Xinjiang - and PPE and other items used in our healthcare sector.\" She said the government should not stop here and should make a \"concerted effort\" to tackle modern slavery in all UK supply chains, as well as banning goods from Xinjiang altogether. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader, said it was a \"significant move\" that came after MPs had campaigned hard. He urged all other government departments to introduce the same regulations, saying: \"We will be sending the most powerful signal to those around the world that exploit and terrorise those weaker than themselves that the swords of justice are on their trail.\" Luke de Pulford, chief executive of anti-slavery campaign group Arise, which pushed for the change, said: \"This is easily the most significant advance in supply chain regulation since the Modern Slavery Act in 2015, and in many ways goes much further. \"I know all in the anti-slavery movement hope that the rest of government follows the health secretary\'s lead on this, and roots out slavery from our supply chains completely.\" Government ‘dragging feet’ on China forced labour Daily Mail donated masks linked to Uighur factory UK firms \'must wake up\' to China\'s cotton slaves', '1 day ago'),
(857, '/news/business-61178311', 9, 'bbc', 'Have we had enough of Netflix?', 'By Jennifer Meierhans & Alex TaylorBBC News Trying to watch some of Netflix\'s more recent series all the way through, says Paul Weiner, feels a bit like cramming frankfurters down your throat in a hotdog eating contest.  Readers outside the US may not share the American enthusiasm for competitive hotdog swallowing. But maybe they can relate to the feeling. We\'ve all spent the last few years, the last two especially, binge-watching, indiscriminately, too mesmerised to click the off-button. Are we maybe just a little bit sick of it? That\'s the fear seizing executives in Netflix\'s boardroom right now. That Mr Weiner, a 28-year-old artist from Denver, Colorado, who loved the streaming service at first, especially for watching old favourites like Star Trek and The Office, typifies a new mood. That after years of skyrocketing subscriber growth, people will switch off, not just their television sets, but their direct debits too. Mr Weiner is one of the hundreds of thousands who have already cancelled, prompting a moment of high drama for the company this week as its share price plummeted and confidence in its future wobbled.  People have begun to ask whether Netflix\'s star, as the world\'s largest streaming service, is beginning to fade. \"Netflix lost some of my favourite shows,\" says Mr Weiner. \"And I never know which show will disappear next.\" He thinks there\'s more clickbait than there was - enticing teaser clips that don\'t live up to expectations - and some poor writing. \"There are better streaming deals than Netflix right now,\" he says. Netflix was the first to introduce households to TV-on-tap in 2007, entering popular culture with its avalanche of output, and even spawning the phrase \"Netflix and chill\" as a euphemism for staying in to have sex. But since then many other streaming services have followed Netflix\'s lead, including HBO, Disney, Apple and Amazon, making it an increasingly crowded market. \"What made Netflix so popular initially was not necessarily its original programming, but the shows it licensed from other production companies, like Friends, giving viewers one convenient place to watch everything they love,\" says entertainment journalist Tufayel Ahmed. \"With companies now taking their shows off the service and putting them on their own streaming platforms, Netflix faces the problem of having to fill the gap.\" They\'ve done that, launching some hugely successful original output, from the lurid regency romp Bridgerton to the brutal Squid Game, high school comedy Sex Education to the touching drama Afterlife.  Sixteen million people signed up in three months at the start of 2020 as coronavirus spread the world and discussing the dubious morality of Tiger King or the historical accuracy of The Crown was a way to switch off from the horror show of the news. But with so many rivals, \"all of which are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into competing with Netflix\",  says Mr Ahmed, it was almost inevitable the company would eventually lose some ground. Mark Mulligan, media analyst at MIDiA Research agrees, pointing to a trend for \"savvy switchers\" to skip between services. \"Everyone had more time and cash during the pandemic which meant the market was artificially buoyant,\" he says. But now he thinks: \"The economy for people\'s attention has peaked and the amount of spare time people have has run out\".  There is also a cost of living crisis to contend with, right around the world. And Netflix, rather than lowering prices has raised them, a move that should help shore up the balance sheet, but has proved unpopular with subscribers, who are themselves feeling the pinch, like 38-year-old Natalie Walters from Catford in South-East London. She hasn\'t cancelled, but she\'s switched from the premium service, which in the UK costs £15.99 a month, to the standard version at £10.99. \"It becomes about choosing what you keep and what you have to cut down or get rid of altogether,\" she says. And 55-year-old Peter Biggins, a coordinator from Norwich has done the same. \"I\'ve been with them from the beginning. They have some good shows, but they\'re not the only player in the market now,\" he says. And he\'s not a fan of the other plan Netflix is reported to be contemplating: cracking down on customers who share passwords with other households. \"If Netflix is going to go after people who have a subscription, they\'re going to annoy them,\" Mr Biggins predicts. And it may not have the outcome they\'re hoping for.  Aram Asai Munoz, a law student in Santiago, Chile, has shared a Netflix account with his parents and sister, who live in separate households, for several years.  Since he first signed up - eager to tune in to crime drama Better Call Saul - the monthly cost of the service has roughly doubled, he says.  Many of his friends have already cancelled over the price hikes and quality of content and he says he might well do the same if the firm does clamp down on password sharing - after all Netflix is a \"frivolity\" compared to the other bills that need paying, he says. \"Netflix somehow expects that by forbidding password sharing people will become direct new customers, but economic reality dictates the opposite: they will simply walk away from the service,\" he says. While unpopular with customers, the new strategy of raising prices and clamping down on password sharing could give the company some headroom, says Julian Aquilina, senior TV analyst at the media research firm Enders Analysis, alongside a plan to offer a cheaper service supported by advertising. But the impact will be limited. A survey of US Netflix users found only 11% used a shared log in. Some 85% were paid subscribers and the rest were on free trials, Kagan Consumer Insights found. That doesn\'t mean Netflix is about to lose too much ground, though, Mr Aquilina says. \"It is not like it is going to fade away anytime soon. It is a great product, people like using it,\" he says. \"The question is, how many more people it will reach in the future. Maybe it won\'t be as much as people expected - it seems those expectations are being reset.\" $50bn wiped off Netflix’s value as subscribers quit TikTok helps UK book sales hit record levels Households cancel streaming services to cut costs Netflix adds 16 million sign-ups in lockdown boost', '1 day ago'),

The 26-year-old is said to have been attacked and robbed outside a bar in Manhattan after performing in New York on Wednesday. He has been forced to postpone his gig in Washington DC on Friday as a result. Grennan\'s track Little Bit of Love was nominated for song of the year at this year\'s Brit Awards. \"In the early hours of this morning after Tom\'s New York show, he was the victim of an unprovoked attack and robbery outside a bar in Manhattan,\" his manager John Dawkins said in a statement posted online on Thursday evening. \"Tom is currently being assessed by doctors for his injuries which include a ruptured ear, torn ear-drum and issue with his previously fractured jaw.\" He added: \"Despite this Tom is in good spirits but needs to temporarily recuperate whilst doctors assess his ability to continue with his touring.\" STATEMENT pic.twitter.com/Zwm3p6ebMx His manager went on to thank Grennan\'s American fans, noting how the singer was \"desperate not to let anyone down\", but that the \"precautionary decision\" had been made to postpone his Washington show until later notice. Electronic producer Mint Royale tweeted his support for the singer, saying: \"Get well soon, sounds awful\". While presenter Rylan Clark-Neal added: \"Sending love mate\". And DJ Mista Jam offered: \"Sending love to you bro\". Grennan initially found fame as the guest vocalist on Chase & Status\'s track All Goes Wrong, and he went on to score a number one solo album with 2021\'s Evering Road.

(859, '/news/entertainment-arts-61067343', 9, 'bbc', 'Heartstopper: LGBTQ+ drama pushing the envelope', 'By Emma SaundersEntertainment reporter Fans of Alice Oseman\'s popular teen webcomic and graphic novel series Heartstopper need no introduction to the TV adaptation which drops on Netflix on Friday. They\'ve probably had it in their diary for months. But for the uninitiated, Heartstopper is a young adult LGBTQ+ story about two teenage boys, Charlie and Nick, who fall for each other at a secondary school, and their friends, Elle, Tao and Isaac. Charlie and Nick - played by newcomer Joe Locke and Rocketman actor Kit Connor - are subjected to homophobic bullying by Nick\'s so-called friends. Elle (Yasmin Finney), a transgender teen, has recently moved from the boys\' grammar school where all her friends are, to the girls\' equivalent, after also suffering cruel taunts. Finney, who has a built up a big following on TikTok, posting about her experiences of being a young, black transgender woman in the UK, endured difficulties at school herself. \"For me, school was the same. There\'s always been [these] voices of toxic masculinity that just clearly aren\'t educated enough. And even if they are, they just want to... have a laugh, but there\'s a point where it crosses the line and I think that\'s what Heartstopper highlights. It goes on every day in high school.  \"I actually started TikTok when I was in my second high school after I moved from my first because I was bullied. What I find is that the people that bullied me in high school, they\'re not really doing much with their lives now. And I\'m actually doing great!\" Locke, who is taking his A-level exams in a couple of weeks, says he was \"very lucky\" with his school experience. \"My school is great and I was never bullied. Once you get to sixth form, things really change because a lot of the people who would be the ones saying things aren\'t there anymore, or people have grown up and realise they don\'t really care anymore, they can just be themselves.\" But he acknowledges it\'s not easy for everyone. \"In general in high school, it\'s really hard. To be different in any way. And if you don\'t fit in with the tracky-wearing, vape-smoking norm, then you\'re likely to be pulled up on that and and seen to be different. \"I think what\'s beautiful about our show is that it celebrates these differences. You may think you\'re the weird one but actually everyone except those few tiny \'norm-fitting\' people are the weird ones. And even they\'re probably only [like] that because they feel that\'s what they have to do to fit in.\" He adds: \"It\'s just as sad for them... because they\'ve been conditioned to feel that\'s how they have to be to fit in and live in our society.\" Social media also has a part to play, of course - in Heartstopper, many of the awkward or delicate conversations between the characters take place online. While it can be a place of support, having a high profile on social media can also open you up to unwarranted abuse. Finney, from Manchester, says you have to be bold to put yourself out there and know when to take a break. \"I think you have to take risks. I\'ve always known that I want to be somebody that other people can look up at, especially the queer youth who don\'t necessarily know where they fit in in society.  And I\'ve always loved documenting my experience as a trans person from the age of 15, 16.\" (She\'s now 18, as is Locke).  Having curated an \"amazing following over the last three years,\" Finney stepped back from TikTok while filming Heartstopper, which is her first professional acting project. \"I just wanted a break. I think sometimes you just have to step away. When I was doing TikToks back in 2019, and 2020, I would compare myself at some points... to everybody else. I just wanted to focus on myself and make sure that I\'m okay mentally.  \"You\'ve just got to have a positive mindset on social media and realise that most of it isn\'t real, most of it is fake. It can be quite overwhelming. But I\'ve learned to harness that... and it\'s definitely made me stronger. I love seeing my community doing well.\" Locke also believes social media is a \"double-edged sword\". \"On one side, it\'s a lot of interaction for our generation and a lot of socialising. On the other hand, it can be overwhelming. There are times where I just have to turn my phone off. It\'s being aware of your boundaries. \"Netflix have been really good in helping us come to terms with what the next few weeks might be like,\" he adds. Writer Oseman has also taken time out from updating the Heartstopper web comic due to \"burnout and intense stress\".  Finney says: \"It\'s always about just knowing your limits. Alice is such a hard worker, and I\'m glad that they\'re taking a break. \"Everything they\'ve done is just magical and to see that reaction to their work coming to life and seeing the characters fit the mould of what they made back in 2012... it\'s amazing.\" Locke tells me Oseman was on set every day and it was \"like having a bible of Heartstopper right there\". He adds: \"I think it\'s really amazing to have a queer show that\'s aimed at a younger audience than say, It\'s A Sin, and it\'s very much a show that I think a lot of people would have wanted when they were younger.\" Finney is particularly pleased to see herself - a young black trans woman - reflected in a major new TV drama. A recent report found LGBT representation on US TV - including on streaming platforms available in the UK -  is at a high, with nearly 12% of regular characters who are LGBT, up 2.8% from last year. The numbers come from a study by LGBT media advocacy group GLAAD. But the study also found there were shortfalls and missing opportunities to tell a wider range of stories about LGBT characters. The Where We Are on TV analysis looked at overall diversity of shows, including those on big streaming platforms such as Netflix, Amazon,  Apple+ and Disney+. \"Acting has always been something that I\'ve wanted to do, but I\'ve just not really seen myself reflected in the media as a black trans woman, especially in the UK. I just could never see myself in the industry... [or] see myself doing well.  \"But it\'s just been crazy how amazing the response has been for Heartstopper and just how needed... trans actors and actresses are in the industry. And I\'m so happy to be part of that world.\" The debate about authentic casting is still ongoing - should gay roles only be played by gay actors, for example? Finney thinks they should. \"It\'s important... so the LGBT community can have a seat at the table. It\'s about representation.  If you had trans people playing cis roles it would be even but right now, and for years and years, we\'ve had cis people play trans characters.  \"Eddie Redmayne won an Oscar for The Danish Girl and then later apologised for it because he realised it\'s a bigger conversation. It\'s more about inclusivity,\" she says. In fact, Redmayne didn\'t actually apologise but he did say he regretted taking the role. \"For so many years, especially trans people, we\'ve just kind of been laughed at through entertainment. Queer people, trans people -  we\'ve been around for generations and millennials,\" Finney says. \"It\'s about the industry realising that they were wrong and they do need this representation.\" Heartstopper is on Netflix from 22 April.

They saw the star\'s widow, Kelsey, lead a hearse pulled by four black horses through Petts Wood, south-east London. On the side of the carriage, flowers spelled the words \"Tom\" and \"Daddy\". The title of the boy band\'s 2011 number one Glad You Came also formed a floral tribute outside St Francis of Assisi church. Stars including One Direction\'s Liam Payne and Parker\'s bandmates from The Wanted were amongst those in attendance. Fans were invited to pay their respects as the funeral procession made its way down the Queensway in Petts Wood. Traffic came to a standstill and the large crowd fell silent as the coffin was carried from the undertaker\'s into the waiting hearse. The silence, save for the occasional dog barking or baby crying, was striking for what is normally a busy high street.  But as the procession set off on the 15-minute walk to the church, the hundreds of fans were encouraged by the celebrant to \"clap and cheer loudly\" - which they duly did. Upon arrival, family and friends made their way into the church as others congregated outside to watch the service on four large TV screens that had been erected outside. Many were in tears, hugging each other. Some were dressed in black, but others wore brightly-coloured T-shirts and hoodies emblazoned with The Wanted\'s logo. Parker\'s bandmates Jay McGuiness, Max George, Siva Kaneswaran and Nathan Sykes carried his coffin into the church as the poignant Champagne Supernova by Oasis played over the speakers.  Parker\'s brother Lewis, his wife Kelsey and his bandmates were among those who shared memories or did readings during the service.  George delivered a touching and often-humorous speech as he shared memories of working with Parker. \"As we were carrying Tom in, I could actually hear him saying, \'It\'s about time\', because he\'s carried us for the last 15 years,\" he joked. \"Tom was and always will be a brother to myself and my bandmates. He made such an impact on us from the start, and his love for music and his striving for success outmatched any of us.\" He continued: \"[Tom] was the only member of The Wanted to have a punch-up with every member of The Wanted.\" The mourners laughed warmly as Kaneswaran, who was standing beside George, added: \"He did lose every fight, by the way.\" \"It is so wonderful to see all the support for Tom,\" Kaneswaran continued. \"There\'s one thing we can all agree on - Tom Parker was an absolute hero.\" George concluded: \"He has left us far too early and we will miss him so much. The heartbreak shared here today is a credit to the love Tom shared. The people outside, the people all around the world, is a credit to him. Rest easy, mate.\" Kelsey\'s eulogy was pre-recorded because, she explained, she would have found it \"too painful to stand up in front of everyone\". In her audio message, she recalled meeting Tom outside a nightclub when she was 19. The singer asked if he could add her on Facebook, \"and the rest is history,\" she said. \"I told everyone from that moment, I\'m going to marry Tom Parker. \"Life with you, Tom, was never boring,\" she continued. \"We spent a lot of our first years together drinking Mahiki [nightclub] dry, dancing all night long, parties in our Battersea flat, and having the funniest, most irrelevant drunken fights. \"Tom, your energy was never-ending and your creativity was out of this world.

You did everything with love and no malice.\"  Parker married Kelsey in 2018, and the couple have two young children, Aurelia Rose and Bodhi. Tom\'s mother, in a message read out by the singer\'s brother Lewis, said: \"We have nothing but love and pride for not only his achievements, but his positive attitude, resourcefulness and determination.  \"We will always be faithfully and unswervingly at his side. He was an amazing son and brother who we love dearly.\" Bolton-born Parker died at the end of March, almost 18 months after he revealed he had been diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour. Kaneswaran remembered Parker\'s \"big Boltonian heart\", adding: \"He was never afraid to stand up for what was right, no matter the risk.\" Other songs played during the service included Handbags and Gladrags by Stereophonics, Live Forever by Oasis, the hymn Amazing Grace and The Wanted\'s own single Gold Forever. As the coffin was taken from the church back to the hearse, some fans released golden heart-shaped balloons from the crowd. After the ceremony, fans comforted each other and shared their memories of meeting Parker and seeing the band in concert. \"Tom has been like a constant in our lives for like 12 years,\" one fan, Bethan, told BBC News.  \"If you tweeted him, he\'d always respond to you and big you up. It was like you were his favourite person in the world whenever you got to speak to him.  \"And he was our favourite person in the world. None of us want to be here, obviously, but we get to do this together.\" Another fan, Tamara, said the large number of people attending the funeral \"just shows the legacy he has created, and the love he has outpoured to so many people\".  \"This love is for Kelsey and the family. We\'re so grateful we got the opportunity to be here for this.\" She added: \"The funeral was a real tribute to Tom. To hear his family speak about him. I wasn\'t even surprised hearing the stories because it was kind of like we know him already. So it was just a beautiful moment to hear those stories.\" Another member of the same group, Maddie, said: \"He was so lovely. He was always welcoming, the nicest person and the loveliest man.\" All four friends had met Parker several times over the years. \"He loved his fame, he knew the power he held with being famous,\" Bethan said. \"So he always made sure he felt the love we\'d been able to give him. He didn\'t take a second for granted with any of us.\" Recalling one encounter with Parker, she said: \"Outside a radio station, I remember him running away from security, trying to come back to us. He wanted to be with us. \"I\'ll cry listening to their music, but I won\'t ever not love listening to it, because that was our communication with him. It\'s going to be painful listening to their music for a long time, but he loved being in The Wanted.\" Bethan and Tamara explained that they were wearing butterfly hairclips in tribute to Tom - the butterfly has been adopted by many fans as a symbol for the band. \"Everything is butterflies because of Gold Forever,\" Bethan explained. \"Could he have written a more perfect song to remember him by? We\'re all getting tattoos of butterflies and the lyrics of Gold Forever, all because of him.\" Fans were seen crying and singing along to Gold Forever as it played at the end of the service. The lyrics seemed particularly fitting at the funeral: \"Say my name like it\'s the last time / Live today like its your last night / We want to cry but we know its alright / \'Cause I\'m with you and you\'re with me / Butterflies, butterflies, we were meant to fly.\" \"You\'ll have seen butterflies everywhere,\" said Bethan. \"If you go on Twitter you\'ll see most of our fan accounts have got the blue butterfly emoji in, and whenever Kelsey posts something there\'s always a butterfly in it, because that\'s our strongest symbol of connection with him.\" The Wanted had 10 UK top-10 singles between 2010 and 2013, including All Time Low, Chasing The Sun, Heart Vacancy and Lightning.

It suggests around 3.76 million people were infected in the week ending 16 April - roughly one in 17 people. This is a fall of about 15% on the week before - when the figure stood at 4.4 million, or around one in 15 people.  Other ONS data suggests more than 70% of people in England have had coronavirus since the pandemic began. ONS officials welcomed the overall decline in infection in the UK in recent weeks, but warned levels of the virus remain high.  The latest study, based on testing by the ONS, gives the clearest available picture of the virus\' spread since free testing ended for most people in England at the beginning of this month.  Some limited free testing for the public will continue in Scotland until the end of April, and in Wales and Northern Ireland until the end of June. The ONS compiles the data by testing thousands of people at random - whether they have symptoms or not - to estimate how much virus there is in the UK.  Duncan Cook, deputy director for the Covid-19 infection survey, said he welcomed the \"continued decrease\" in infections across England, Northern Ireland and Scotland, as well as Wales, where infections  have fallen for the first time in several weeks. He added it was \"encouraging\" to see that infections had decreased \"in all age groups\" across England. But cautioned: \"Despite the decrease in infections, it is important to note that levels remain high. We continue to monitor these going forward.\" In the week ending 16 April, the study estimates: The study shows infections fell in all English regions apart from the North East, where the trend was uncertain and where infection rates remain the highest in England. The Omicron BA.2 sub-variant - which was partly behind the recent surge in cases - continues to be responsible for most cases across the UK, though levels are falling. Other UK data shows the number of people being admitted to hospital with Covid continues on a downward trend. Figures had risen from about 1,100 a day in mid-February to nearly 2,400 by the end of March, but have since dropped to about 2,200 admissions per day. Meanwhile the number of hospital patients in intensive care with the virus, who require ventilators, stands at around 350.

Chair of the Women and Equality Committee Caroline Nokes said pharmacy supplies of oestrogen gel had run out in her Hampshire constituency. One manufacturer has reported exceptionally high demand for its gel in recent months.  The government said alternatives were available to women.  Oestrogel manufacturer Besins Healthcare says it is working to meet the increased needs by doubling the amount it can supply.  Some women in Northern Ireland are borrowing each other\'s HRT medication due to supply shortages, according to a menopause support group. During business questions in the House of Commons on Thursday, Ms Nokes called for a debate to ensure \"we can get the supplies that we need\". She said: \"Pharmacies in Romsey and Southampton North have completely run out, which leaves women of a certain age - and before my honourable friend from North Dorset makes a comment... yes, I declare an interest - without access to the oestrogen gel, which enables us to sleep and to work competently.\" Millions of women in the UK experience menopause symptoms such as hot flushes, low mood and anxiety. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can help with this. It\'s a taboo issue which has been raised by TV presenter Davina McCall, as well as other high-profile celebrities. She campaigned for prescription costs to be cut to help more women access the treatment.  In October, the Government announced new policies related to menopause support, including changes to prescription charges.  It said the cost of repeat prescriptions for HRT would be significantly reduced in England. That means women will be able to pay £18.70 once a year - saving up to £200 annually. However, Pharmacy Minister Maria Caulfield recently said the move would not be enacted until April 2023. The Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPS) condemned the delay, saying it will \"frustrate many\".  Chair of RPS in England, Thorrun Govind, said: \"Women experiencing the menopause need support to stay well and remain in the workplace. For some, HRT prescriptions are an essential part of this, but also a financial drain during a cost-of-living crisis. \"We believe everyone should have access to the medicines they need, regardless of ability to pay, and will continue to call on the Government to scrap prescription charges in England altogether.\" HRT has grown in popularity, and prescriptions have more than doubled in England since 2017. Some 583,000 prescriptions were made in December 2021 alone, across all NHS GP practices in England.  The British Menopause Society advises women who are experiencing difficulty obtaining oestrogen gel to consider other HRT preparations, even if they are not an exact match.  It said the pandemic had made accessing treatment harder for some.  Dr Nighat Arif, who is a GP, told BBC\'s Women\'s Hour: \"We have been struggling to get supply of Oestrogel.\" She said the treatment was a lifeline for some women, preventing HRT symptoms and protecting their health.  She said she was prescribing alternative treatments, but that was time-consuming and could be distressing and problematic for the patient. \"They are slightly different and they might not be suitable for that individual.\" Women \'borrow menopause drugs due to shortage\' HRT: Davina McCall hails \'brilliant day for women\'', '1 day ago'),

The team says the unprecedented amount of data allowed them to uncover new patterns in the DNA of cancer - hinting at causes that are not yet understood. They add that the genetic clues will ultimately help improve diagnosis and treatment. The research is published in Science. Cancer can be thought of as a corrupted version of our own healthy cells - mutations to our DNA change our cells until eventually they grow and divide uncontrollably. Traditionally many cancers have been categorised by doctors based on where they are in the body and the type of cells involved -  but whole genome sequencing can provide another layer of key information. Whole genome sequencing is relatively new, but is already available on the NHS for a small number of specific cancers, including some blood cancers. The NHS long-term plan aims to make it more widely available, through the NHS Genomic Medicine Service. Lead researcher Prof Serena Nik-Zainal, a consultant at Cambridge University Hospitals, told the BBC the study was like an \"archaeological dig\" of people\'s cancer. She added: \"We can see the patterns or imprints in the field of their cancers - like dinosaur footprints - of what is going wrong with their cancers.  \"And everyone\'s cancer is different. To know we can personalise each person\'s cancer report means we are a step closer to personalising treatment for them.\" Led by the University of Cambridge, the research team analysed anonymised DNA data provided by the 100,000 Genomes Project - an England-wide project to sequence the whole genomes of patients affected by cancer and rare diseases.  With thousands of genetic changes seen in each tumour they analysed, researchers were able to detect specific combinations of genetic alterations - so-called \"mutational signatures\" - that may be key to cancers developing.   Comparing the data to other international genetic cancer projects, they confirmed patterns that are already known, and uncovered 58 new ones. This video can not be played Some signatures can provide clues about whether patients have had exposure to environmental causes of cancers - such as smoking. Others provide more information about genetic abnormalities that may be amenable to specific drugs, researchers say.  Researchers also created a computer programme to help scientists and doctors check whether patients who have had whole genome sequencing have any of the newly discovered mutational clues. Aubrey, a two-year-old girl from Bedfordshire, was diagnosed with cancer when she was only 16 months old.  She did not take part in the study. But whole genome sequencing helped doctors identify the type of cancer she has - a rhabdomyosarcoma - a rare cancer that generally affects muscles attached to bones. The results helped make sure she is on the best treatment.  Anna, Aubrey\'s mother, said: \"Because of the unusual way Aubrey\'s cancer presented, the doctors were not sure of the exact cancer type.  \"The whole genome sequence test helped doctors to know how to treat her and keep her stable.  \"Whilst we still have a challenging journey with Aubrey\'s diagnosis and treatment, we are relieved to know she does not have cancer that was inherited, and we do not have to worry that it could affect our son or other members of the family as well.\" Source: NHS England Prof Matt Brown, chief scientific officer of Genomics England, said: \"Mutational signatures are an example of using the full potential of whole genome sequencing.  \"We hope to use the mutational clues seen in this study and apply them back into our patient population, with the ultimate aim of improving diagnosis and management of cancer patients.\" The research is supported by Cancer Research UK.

The unnamed individual had other underlying medical conditions and died in hospital in 2021.  Persistent infections such as this are still rare, say the London medics.  Most people naturally clear the virus, but the patient in question had a severely weakened immune system.  Chronic infections like these need studying to improve our understanding of Covid and the risks it can pose, say experts. The patient first caught Covid in early 2020. They had symptoms and the infection was confirmed with a PCR test.  They were in and out of hospital many times over the next 72 weeks, for both routine checks and care.  On each occasion - about 50 in all - they tested positive, meaning they still had Covid.  The doctors, from King\'s College London and Guy\'s and St Thomas\' NHS Foundation Trust, say detailed lab analysis revealed it was the same, persistent infection, rather than repeated bouts.  The patient could not shake the infection, even after being given antiviral drugs.  This is different to \"long Covid\", where symptoms persist after the infection has gone. One of the medics who will be presenting the findings at a medical conference - the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases - is Dr Luke Blagdon Snell.  He told the BBC: \"These were throat swab tests that were positive each time. The patient never had a negative test. And we can tell it was one continuous infection because the genetic signature of it - the information we got from sequencing the viral genome - was unique and constant in that patient.\" Prolonged infections are rare but important, say the researchers, because they might give rise to new variants of Covid - although that did not happen in this case, or other ones that they studied. Dr Snell said: \"The virus is still adapting to the human host when people are infected for a long time. It might provide an opportunity for Covid to accrue new mutations.  \"Some of these patients that we have studied have mutations that have been seen in some of the variants of concern.\" He stressed that none of the nine patients they checked had spawned a new dangerous variant.  Someone with a chronic infection might not be contagious to others, he added. Dr David Strain from the University of Exeter Medical School, said: \"We know that every time the virus replicates, it must reproduce its RNA - equivalent to manually copying a text book. We know if we were to transcribe an entire book we would make mistakes, so too does the virus. Every copy will produce mutations.  \"Although Omicron did not arise in these particular individuals, this demonstrates a very clear pathway by which vaccine resistant variants may arise. Whereas with BA.2 we have got lucky, that the mutation is associated with a less severe illness, there is no guarantee that the next iteration will be the same.\" The man who tested positive for Covid 43 times \'I\'ve had long Covid for two years now\' Woman caught Covid twice within record 20 days ECCMID 2022', '1 day ago'),

They say it is increasingly likely a virus which causes flu symptoms, known as adenovirus, could be the cause. Officials are examining 79 confirmed cases in England, 14 in Scotland and 15 across Wales and Northern Ireland. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said eight children had received a liver transplant as a result. The first sign of an unusual rise in young children with liver inflammation was spotted in Scotland in late March. Most of the children hospitalised so far are thought to be between the ages of one and five years old.  UKHSA\'s chief medical advisor, Professor Susan Hopkins, says that officials were still looking at a range of possible factors that could be behind the increase, but \"the most likely\" trigger was an adenovirus - a group of common viruses which usually cause colds, vomiting and diarrhoea in children. \"Transplants in this age group are extremely rare so therefore we are concerned, and we want to understand why this is happening and what else we can do,\" she told the BBC. Prof Hopkins says 77% of childhood hepatitis cases currently under investigation have tested positive for some form of adenovirus.  Scientists and clinicians are now investigating whether there has been a change in the genetic make-up - or genome - of the virus that might trigger liver inflammation more easily. Another possible explanation is that restrictions imposed in the pandemic may have led to young children being first exposed to adenovirus at a slightly later point in their lives, leading to a \"more vigorous\" immune response. The UKHSA says it is keeping an \"open mind\" and not ruling out other possible causes, including Covid-19, other infections or an environmental trigger. But it says there is \"no link\" with the Covid-19 vaccine, as none of the children involved has been vaccinated. To minimise the chance of an infection, Prof Hopkins says parents should supervise good handwashing and hygiene at home.  \"The good things that we\'ve learnt from reducing transmission of Covid will help us reduce the transmission of whatever is causing this as well,\" she says. The UKHSA has told parents and guardians to be on the lookout for the signs of hepatitis such as jaundice - a yellowing of the eyes and skin - and contact a GP if they are concerned. Other symptoms of the liver condition include: Earlier this week, the European Centre for Disease Control said an undisclosed number of childhood hepatitis cases had also been detected in Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands and Spain.  In the US, Alabama\'s public-health department said nine cases had been found in one- to six-year-olds, with two needing liver transplants. It\'s a broad term used to describe inflammation of the liver. Usually the result of a viral infection, it can also be caused by exposure to some chemicals, drinking too much alcohol, drugs and certain genetic disorders. There are five main types of hepatitis caused by specific viruses - known as A, B, C, D and E - but none of those  so far appears to have caused the liver inflammation seen in these children. Some types of hepatitis can pass without any serious problems, while others can be long-lasting.

The sixth-former from Gorslas, Carmarthenshire, said her period education had been \"pretty shocking\".   It comes as a Swansea University study found menstrual cycle education needed to be addressed in schools.   The Welsh government said period education would become mandatory as part of a new curriculum. The other UK nations said they have taken action.  Efa said she remembers having a puberty lesson in the final year of primary school and, at the end, the boys were sent out.  \"You just get told \'oh, by the way at some point you\'re going to be bleeding for three-eight days once a month\',\" she said.  \"There was no education about why, or symptoms before or after or hormone changes.\" She said she and her friends educated themselves online more than they learned in the classroom.  \"I just don\'t feel like the education system has changed at all since when my mam was younger,\" she added.  Lili Mai, 17, said her class was not really given information about why they had periods. \"There was no deeper explanation, we weren\'t talking about pain or cramps, anything that comes with it. I had to figure that out as I went along,\" she said.  Ffion, 17, from Ammanford, said she doesn\'t remember much about the lesson, other than a stranger coming into class.  \"We weren\'t educated on tampons, menstrual cups... it was just the basics that led to problems years on when I started my periods. It\'s just really sad,\" she added.  It\'s a story Natalie Brown is familiar with.  She works with elite female athletes looking at the impact of their periods and their cycle on performance.  It was their lack of knowledge that led her to question what was being taught in schools.  \"What we very much find is actually there is minimal education in school,\" she added. The academic led the report by Swansea University, funded by Sport Wales, looking at menstrual cycle education in the UK.   The sport scientist said more than 90% of teachers that responded to the survey were female and often they drew on their own personal experiences.   The report recommended giving teachers more time, training and support to deliver classes regularly as well as providing more information on the emotional and social aspects of the menstrual cycle.  It also found that teachers felt periods affected attendance, participation in exercise, as well as behaviour and confidence.  \"To me that shows it is an area that we need to support girls more on because it can have an effect on school performance, exam results... these kind of longer-term health and wellbeing benefits,\" she added.  Kathryn King runs the Bloody Honest social media account which she said aims to fill the gaps in period education.  She said the responses she gets to her videos highlight the desperate need for information.  \"One of the most common questions I get is \'where\'s my vagina and how many holes do I have?\' \"It\'s baffling to me that there\'s such a gap in the knowledge of young people and it\'s just filled by friends or family if they\'re lucky... and, if not, strangers on the internet,\" she said.  The 26 year old has no medical training but felt the urge to educate others about periods after learning about her own in her early 20s.  \"The more you know, the sooner you can recognise any abnormalities for you... and the sooner you can speak to a doctor and have that checked and potentially that is life changing,\" she said. The Welsh government said, within the new curriculum framework, teachers will be able to focus on a wide range of health and wellbeing topics.  \"It is important that learning about menstrual wellbeing is not simply a \'one-off lesson\' which is why the Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) Code sets out that it should be taught at various stages of the curriculum,\" it added.  The Scottish government said learning about periods and menstruation started in primary schools and was an important part of health and wellbeing education.  \"Local authorities and schools can use a wide range of resources to deliver age and stage appropriate lessons,\" it said.  In Northern Ireland, the government said period education was provided to both primary and post-primary schools.   \"Pupils have the opportunity to learn about scientific facts and engage in open conversation,\" it said. \"This can help to break down common taboos about periods, prevent stigma and reduce negative perceptions and behaviours.\"   The UK government said pupils in England should learn about periods, including its impact on physical and mental health, as a mandatory part of the curriculum.  \"We have invested millions in rolling out the curriculum and are supporting teachers with training and guidance, so that they can gain the knowledge to teach it confidently and foster open conversations with their students,\" it said.

But she wanted to know when she would get her life back. \"I was Googling at 3am when I found a journal article. I remember seeing lots of responses from people saying they wouldn\'t mind dating someone who had had cancer but they would prefer for them to have finished treatment,\" she said. \"I remembered thinking that was so rubbish.\" She initially decided to postpone her thoughts of dating - but a few weeks later she changed her mind and made a profile on a dating app. \"The next dilemma was what picture to use on my dating profile, because my hair was only a centimetre long as I was getting chemo,\" said Katherine, who is now aged 32. \"I had been wearing long blonde wigs but normally I had long brown hair. \"The long hair was not who I currently was but I didn\'t want cancer to be my defining feature either by using the short hair pictures.\" She ended up using a selection of photographs for her profile, but not saying she had cancer. Katherine said she felt \"a bit deceitful\" in the early stages of communicating with people, because she wasn\'t giving them the full story. But when she moved to messaging people directly outside the dating app, she would tell them she had cancer. \"I told them they could pull out and just to stop texting me if me having cancer was a problem for them,\" she said. \"But nobody was upset by it. It\'s all about how you present yourself. \"It\'s your attitude by not presenting it as an issue or a problem - I wasn\'t recruiting for a carer.\" Katherine spent a year living in her father\'s house after her cancer diagnosis, but moved out in the spring of 2021.

Katherine then replied to say that she was his new flatmate. \"I was mortified and wanted the ground to swallow me up,\" said Angus. \"When she had viewed the flat she had short hair and a mask on, but in the pictures she had long hair.\" Katherine met someone else who was \"very understanding\", but they broke up in September just as she was finishing her chemotherapy.

It warns of \"dystopian\" consequences unless copyright law adapts. Equity highlights a number of different ways actors\' voices and likenesses may be used. For example actors may work with AI firms to create systems that can generate artificial voice-overs or to help them create digital \"avatars\". And \"synthetic\" performances can be created using AI, in some cases even allowing deceased actors to appear in films.  While AI-generated performances can be a useful creative tool, the union is concerned that actors may not always be able to control the use of their likeness, or their likeness may be used without consent or adequate remuneration. AI generated \"deep fake\" videos of celebrities have become increasingly popular online. Actor Talulah Riley who supports the campaign told the union \"As a performer, it is vital that my voice and my image are my own, no matter how easily and cheaply those things can be digitally replicated. I believe that performers must be rewarded fairly for the content we create.\" Where actors work with AI companies, most do not know their rights, and many are required to sign non-disclosure agreements the union says. In a survey of 430 of its members the union found that 93% of audio artists felt that AI posed a threat to their employment opportunities. One respondent to the survey told the union: \"In the last six months, my voice has been used in huge marketing campaigns by global companies. I don\'t receive a penny, even though I believe my contract does not allow for third party advertising.\" Equity said: \"AI\'s increasing capacity to clone human voices presents a substantial risk that the voice owner will either be under-compensated or not paid at all . Equity says it is particularly concerned about the development of digital voice technology for automated audiobook creation. The campaign is backed by Bev Standing who sued TikTok over the use of her voice. The Canadian voiceover artist recorded about 10,000 sentences of audio for the state-backed Chinese Institute of Acoustics research body to use in translations, in 2018. But her voice, Ms Standing alleged, was later used by TikTok in a feature which converted writing into speech, which could then be played over videos uploaded to the app, often for comedic effect. This included, Ms Standing claimed, videos where the synthetic voice repeated profanities. TikTok settled the lawsuit.  Ms Standing told equity \"I now only work with companies where I have control over where my voice gets licensed\". The union argues existing copyright law does not give performers sufficient protection, because AI \"reproduces performances without generating a recording or a copy\". Equity wants the government to take action to protect performers\' rights and wants reform of copyright laws to \"keep pace with technological development\". However there may be concerns that changes to copyright law could have a negative impact on free speech or stifle innovation. The government told the BBC it wanted to ensure AI was regulated in a way that encouraged innovation \"while protecting people and our fundamental values\". \"Our national AI strategy has a ten-year vision for seizing the opportunities of the technology and we will set out our approach to its governance in due course\" a government statement said.

The emoji - or hashflag - featured a golden square with four \"L\" shaped arms reminiscent of the arms of a swastika. Well that was obviously really embarrassing.We’re not sure how that emoji got through several layers of review without anyone noticing, but we immediately flagged the issue, pulled it down, and the new emoji design is being rolled out as we speak.

Those affected will have their accounts put in \"withdrawal-only mode\". No deposits or trading will be permitted. The company said the move followed the latest sanctions imposed by the European Union. Previously the exchange rejected calls from Ukraine to block Russian users. Mr Zhao told the BBC in an interview in early March that \"many normal Russians do not agree with war\". In giving notice of these new measures, the company said that while they were potentially restrictive to normal Russian citizens, \"Binance must continue to lead the industry in implementing these sanctions\".

(880, '/news/science-environment-61175261', 6, 'bbc', 'OneWeb satellite firm will use Indian rockets', 'Jonathan AmosScience correspondent@BBCAmoson Twitter OneWeb, the satellite company part-owned by the UK government, has done a deal to use Indian rockets. The arrangement will supplement the contract the London-headquartered firm has with American rival and rocket operator SpaceX of California. The new deal was announced as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnston headed to India for two days of talks. The firm was forced to look for alternatives when its deal with the Russian space agency fell apart. OneWeb said the first Indian launch of its broadband internet satellites could take place by the year\'s end. The spacecraft would go up from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre on Sriharikota Island in the east of the country. The rocket to be used is likely to be India\'s Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), its largest and most capable vehicle. Some sort of deal with NewSpace India, the commercial arm of the country\'s national space agency, was expected. OneWeb\'s largest shareholder is the Indian conglomerate Bharti Global. Its chairman, Sunil Bharti Mittal, is also the executive chairman at OneWeb.  \"This is yet another historic day for collaboration in space, thanks to the shared ambition and vision of NewSpace India and OneWeb,\" he said in a statement. \"This most recent agreement on launch plans adds considerable momentum to the development of OneWeb\'s network, as we work together across the space industry toward our common goal of connecting communities globally.\" OneWeb\'s plans to build a global network of internet satellites in the sky was knocked off course in March by the war in Ukraine. The conflict, and the resulting western sanctions against Russia, led to the company losing access to Russian Soyuz rockets. With only two-thirds of the satellites in orbit needed to complete its network, OneWeb had little choice but to go to SpaceX to book some rides on the California outfit\'s Falcon rockets. SpaceX is currently building its own space-borne internet service called Starlink. OneWeb didn\'t say how many Indian launches it would use, or what its contract with NewSpace India was worth.  The GSLV can lift about nine tonnes to low-Earth orbit - similar to the Soyuz. It was last used in 2019 to launch India\'s Chandrayaan-2 Moon mission. OneWeb has so far launched 428 satellites, enough to provide internet broadband connections above 50 degrees North in latitude. It needs, however, to get to 650 or so to start delivering connections across the whole Earth. The company\'s intention is to expand later generations of the network to encompass 7,000 satellites in orbit, meaning the GSLV could become a key component in the future of the OneWeb project. \"We welcome the partnership between OneWeb and NewSpace India Limited (NSIL); it\'s a historic development and this will surely pave the way for a greater participation of private space players, resulting in a boost to the Indian space economy,\" said Lt. Gen. Anil Kumar Bhatt (Retd), the director general of the Indian Space Association. \"This partnership has the potential to drive the attention of many international players towards India\'s capabilities, leading to a significant increase in our share in the international space economy which is just 2.6% currently; and at the same time contribute to nation building and economic growth of the country,\" he told BBC News.    Building space-borne internet systems is the vogue of the moment. As well as OneWeb and SpaceX-Starlink, the Amazon online retailer is about to get into this market. Earlier this month it signed the largest commercial launch deal ever,  purchasing up to 83 launches from three separate rocket companies to loft its Kuiper system. This would see more than 3,000 internet broadband satellites placed in low-Earth orbit over a period of five years.', '@BBCAmoson Twitter'),

Despite the firm facing higher costs, profits at Elon Musk\'s electric car company soared to $3.3bn (£2.5bn) in the first three months of the year, as customers proved willing to pay more. The firm\'s deliveries were up 68% - and would have been higher if not for supply chain shortages, the firm said. Its Shanghai factory was also recently forced shut due to Covid restrictions. As the plant reopens this month, staff will be required to sleep at the factory in an effort to avoid further lockdowns, Bloomberg has reported. \"Although limited production has recently restarted, we continue to monitor the situation closely,\" Tesla said as it shared quarterly results with investors. Tesla has been pushing to expand, opening new factories in Texas and Germany in recent weeks. The firm delivered more than 310,000 cars in the first three months of the year and in a conference call, chief executive Elon Musk predicted the company would produce 60% more cars during the year as a whole compared to last year. Tesla doesn\'t advertise its products, but attracts frequent headlines, often related to controversial comments made by Mr Musk. But the firm said that it had also seen spikes in orders following increased marketing from rival electric car makers. Mr Musk said Tesla expects to mass produce a robotaxi with no steering wheel or pedals by 2024. While Tesla shares rose more than 5% in after-hours trade, following the strong results, some investors worry Mr Musk may be distracted from his focus on the electric carmaker as it expands. Mr Musk, known for his sometimes erratic musings on Twitter, recently made an unsolicited offer to buy the social media platform for $43bn.

The number of households using the streaming service fell by 200,000 in the first three months of the year as it faced stiff competition from rivals.  It was also hit after it raised prices in some countries and left Russia. Netflix warned shareholders another two million subscribers were likely to leave in the three months to July. \"Our revenue growth has slowed considerably,\" the firm told shareholders on Tuesday after publishing its first quarter results. \"Our relatively high household penetration - when including the large number of households sharing accounts - combined with competition, is creating revenue growth headwinds.\" The streaming giant estimates more than 100 million households watch the service for free using shared passwords.  Boss Reed Hastings previously described the practice as \"something you have to learn to live with\", adding that much of it is \"legitimate\" between family members. The firm also said account sharing had probably fuelled its growth by getting more people using Netflix.  But on Tuesday, Mr Hastings said it was making it hard to attract new subscribers in some countries. \"When we were growing fast, it wasn\'t a high priority to work on [account sharing]. And now we\'re working super hard on it,\" he told shareholders.  The firm said payment plans it is testing to curb password sharing in Latin America could be rolled out to other countries. Since last month, account holders in Chile, Costa Rica and Peru must pay to add user profiles for people outside their household (the company currently allows people who live together to share their Netflix account).  Users can add up to two extra profiles for $2-$3 (£1.53-£2.30) a month each, on top of their regular fee.  Netflix - which did not say how it would enforce the rule - said it was seeking a \"customer centric\" solution. \"The principle way we have is asking our members to pay a bit more to share the service outside their homes,\" said Greg Peters, Netflix\'s chief product officer. Dominic Sunnebo, an analyst at research firm Kantar, warned the plan could backfire at a time when consumers were looking for ways to save money. \"If the schemes to counter password sharing move too fast and too aggressively, it also risks alienating a potential future audience - many who password-share beyond the household are not actually aware they\'re breaking the terms of their subscription.\"  Netflix said that pulling out of Russia in March in response to the Ukraine war had cost it 700,000 subscribers.  And another 600,000 people stopped using its service in the US and Canada after it put up prices in January. The firm raised prices across all of its US plans, with a basic plan increasing from $9 to $10 per month, and a standard from $14 to $15.50. In the UK, basic and standard plans have both increased by £1 a month to £6.99 and £10.99 respectively. Netflix said the price rises would yield more money for the firm, despite the cancellations. But analysts say the rising cost of streaming services is wearing on households as the cost of living rises.  In the UK, households cancelled more than 1.5 million streaming subscriptions in the first three months of the year, with 38% saying they wanted to save money.  Seeming to acknowledge this, Mr Hastings said Netflix was looking at launching a free ad-supported service like its rivals Disney and HBO.  Analysts say it could open a significant new revenue stream for the company, which has so far shunned advertising. \"Those who have followed Netflix know that I\'ve been against the complexity of advertising, and a big fan of the simplicity of subscription,\" he said. \"But, as much as I\'m a fan of that, I\'m a bigger fan of consumer choice.\" Netflix\'s biggest threat is intense competition from firms such as Amazon, Apple and Disney, which are pouring money into their online streaming services, according to experts. Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight, said Netflix\'s subscriber loss was a \"reality check\", as it tries to balance retaining subscribers with raising its revenue. Tell us how you have been affected by the issues raised in this story. \"While Netflix and other services were key in lockdown, users are now thinking twice about their purchasing behaviour based upon changing habits,\" he said. North America especially is \"now awash with too many services chasing too few dollars\", he added.  Shares in the streaming giant plunged in early trade in New York on Wednesday, dropping more than 30% off the back of the update. The firm - which remains the world\'s leading streaming service with more than 220 million subscribers - had enjoyed uninterrupted quarterly growth in subscribers since October 2011.  However, it said a surge in sign-ups during the pandemic had \"obscured\" the real picture around its growth. It made revenue of $7.8bn (£6bn) in the first three months of the year, up 9.8% compared with the same period last year.  That marked a slowdown from earlier quarters, while profits fell more than 6% to roughly $1.6bn Households cancel streaming services to cut costs Bridgerton gets third and fourth series on Netflix Antiques stolen during filming of The Crown', '3 days ago'),

US Vice-President Kamala Harris, who chairs the National Space Council, said such tests were reckless. The US, China, India and Russia have all carried them out and have generated space debris in doing so.  \"Simply put, these tests are dangerous, and we will not conduct them,\" she said.  Speaking at the Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, Ms Harris said it was part of the Biden administration\'s strategy to promote responsible use of space. She said stopping the direct ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) missile testing will safeguard satellites in low-Earth orbit - and she urged other nations to follow suit. \"This debris presents a risk to the safety of our astronauts, our satellites and our growing commercial presence,\" she said.  \"A piece of space debris the size of a basketball, which travels at thousands of miles per hour, would destroy a satellite. Even a piece of debris as small as a grain of sand could cause serious damage.\" In November last year, Russia test-launched an anti-satellite missile that struck a defunct Soviet-era spy satellite in low-Earth orbit, creating at least 1,632 pieces of space debris, according to a US Space Force database of orbital objects. The debris posed risks to active satellites in orbit. US astronauts aboard the International Space Station were forced to seek shelter in their docked capsule, which disrupted their work. If the debris collides with functioning satellites, vital services like GPS and weather warnings could be in jeopardy. China conducted a similar test in 2007. Vice-President Harris said: \"Today, we are taking a major step forward in this effort, a step that specifically addresses the problem of destructive missile tests in space, like the one Russia took in November.  \"That, of course, is when Russia launched a missile to destroy a satellite in space. \"These tests are part of their efforts to develop anti-satellite weapons systems. These weapons are intended to deny the United States our ability to use our space capabilities by disrupting, destroying our satellites - satellites which are critical to our national security.\" Overall, these tests jeopardise the long-term sustainability of outer space and imperil the exploration and use of space by all nations, she added. The announcement comes amid increased US intelligence co-operation with Ukraine, as Russia\'s invasion drags on. The US first indicated its support for an anti-satellite weapon test ban in December.

The Gunners came into the game on an upswing after ending a run of three successive defeats with victory at Chelsea, while United were attempting to bounce back from a humiliating 4-0 loss at Liverpool.  And Arsenal took three crucial points as the visitors paid the price for shambolic defending and a missed penalty by Bruno Fernandes that undermined an enterprising attacking display.  Nuno Tavares put Arsenal in front after only three minutes following errors from Raphael Varane and Alex Telles, the defender turning in a simple finish after David de Gea saved Bukayo Saka\'s shot. Eddie Nketiah then had an effort ruled out by the video assistant referee for offside but after being called to look at his pitchside monitor the referee awarded a penalty for a foul by Telles on Saka immediately before Nketiah\'s shot, and Saka converted from the spot. United were a real danger in attack, the returning Cristiano Ronaldo deservedly pulling a goal back before the break for his 100th Premier League goal. It set the scene for a United siege, only for Fernandes to waste their big chance by carelessly rolling a second-half spot-kick against the post after Tavares handled.  Arsenal cashed in on the reprieve when Granit Xhaka sealed the win by lashing home the Gunners\' third from 25 yards with 20 minutes remaining. Arsenal\'s win completed a superb response to three league losses that had jeopardised their top-four hopes.  Mikel Arteta\'s side had to fight through adversity - they were not convincing defensively and had several escapes - but they seized their chances when they came to take full advantage of United\'s carelessness in front of goal.  Tavares gave them the perfect start and while goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale had a mixed afternoon, he also made some crucial saves, one from Telles early on and another from Diogo Dalot proving significant.  But Xhaka\'s thumping drive gave De Gea no chance and there was a real mood of celebration inside Emirates Stadium at the final whistle.  Arsenal have inflicted serious damage on any slim hopes United may have had of reaching the top four while maintaining the pressure on north London rivals Tottenham in the battle to qualify for next season\'s Champions League. While Manchester United\'s performance bore no resemblance to the embarrassing capitulation at Liverpool, the end result was still the same and their hopes of taking a place in next season\'s Champions League are fading fast. They are now six points behind Arsenal, having played a game more and with only four league matches left.  Interim manager Ralf Rangnick has become increasingly outspoken about their failings, likening what needs to be done at Old Trafford under new manager Erik ten Hag to \"open heart surgery\". He rang the changes here, dropping Harry Maguire after a traumatic week in which the United captain not only suffered a nightmare display at Liverpool but also had to cope with police conducting a sweep of his home after a bomb threat. It did not have the desired effect as United were let down by defensive frailty despite a performance that contained real menace going forward.  United were also left complaining bitterly when they were not awarded a first-half penalty after Cedric Soares appeared to handle. Dalot twice struck the woodwork and Ramsdale was called into action often, so the commitment could not be questioned here.  There was much that was good about United\'s display but the decisive moment was that second-half penalty miss by Fernandes with Arsenal hanging on desperately at 2-1.  He went through an elaborate jig before carelessly rolling his spot-kick against the post. In that moment Arsenal were reprieved and United struggling, before Xhaka finished them off.

United were a real danger in attack, the returning Cristiano Ronaldo deservedly pulling a goal back before the break for his 100th Premier League goal. It set the scene for a United siege, only for Fernandes to waste their big chance by carelessly rolling a second-half spot-kick against the post after Tavares handled.

(894, '/sport/football/61125002', 2, 'bbc', 'Fans\' pitch protest delays Oldham relegation', 'Oldham Athletic\'s impending relegation from the English Football League has been delayed by an on-pitch protest against the ownership which forced the abandonment of their match against Salford City. The Latics, who needed to avoid defeat to keep their hopes of League Two survival alive after wins for both Barrow and Stevenage, trailed 2-1 with 11 minutes to play against Salford when fans poured on to the field. The players were taken off by referee Robert Madeley as supporters staged a centre-circle sit-in against owner Abdallah Lemsagam, and remained in place despite appeals from boss John Sheridan to return to the stands. Fans were told the game had been abandoned, while Oldham then stated to BBC Radio Manchester that there would be no post-match reaction from Sheridan - himself a former Latics player along with brother Darren. The BBC has contacted the EFL for comment. Relegation to the National League would mark a huge fall from grace for a club who were founder members of the Premier League, League Cup finalists 32 years ago and Wembley FA Cup semi-finalists as recently as 1994. In a cruel twist of fate, they are set to begin their first season outside of the EFL in 116 years in non-league on the 30th anniversary of the breakaway division - becoming the first side from the top tier post-1992 to dip out of the league. \"This is a pitch invasion for all the wrong reasons. We\'ve had them for the right reasons when we have done well and got great results,\" Oldham legend Andy Ritchie - who was a part of the early 1990s success - told BBC Radio Manchester. \"This doesn\'t help anything. The fans are frustrated, I know they are. They want a change of ownership but you do it in a different way. \"You don\'t stop a football game, you wait until the game is over. If you have to show you emotions you show it then. They can do it in a better way. \"It looks as if there is trouble outside the ground as well. It\'s a sad day for the football club. I hate to see this.\" Oldham\'s likely drop rounds off a miserable spell for the club in recent times. Keith Curle, appointed in March 2021, looked set to inspire some hope in the beleaguered Latics when he arrived at Boundary Park. Arriving at the club having won promotion from the fourth tier with Northampton as recently as 2020, supporters would be forgiven for thinking he could turn around the fortunes of a club who have slumped to their lowest point in recent memory. It took seven games to find a win in any competition this term and the club\'s form did not noticeably improve in the first half of the campaign. Curle left in November, just eight months into his tenure, amid the backdrop of heightened tensions with the club\'s support. Three fans were banned in December for \"promoting their dislike\" of the club, with one of the trio branding it a \"dictatorship\". The bans - which were issued directly by the club and were not court-issued football banning orders - were overturned just two days later after a public outcry, but the damage was done. Protests continued and less than a month later Lemsagam announced that he was willing to sell the club, a U-turn on the position he had taken in September 2021 when he claimed he did not want to. Under his tenure there have been accusations of late payment of salaries and threats of player strikes - as well as the prospect of administration, which was eventually avoided. After more than a month without a permanent manager, Sheridan arrived in January for his sixth stint at the club. Despite a bright run of form in February which took them out of the League Two drop zone, as well as two successive wins in March and April, nine defeats in the past 11 games before Saturday saw a slide into trouble. Salford, who needed the points to maintain their play-off hopes, took an early lead through ex-Oldham striker Matt Smith who tucked into an open goal. Davis Keillor-Dunn stroked home a penalty to give the home side hope after a handball by Jordan Turnbull, but Brandon Thomas-Asante\'s near-post header in first-half injury time restored the Salford lead. With pressure mounting, Oldham went for the goal they needed to delay the drop, with Keillor-Dunn\'s tame chip saved by Tom King after Jamie Hopcutt\'s header was ruled out.

(924, '/sport/football/fan-led-review-government-premier-league-efl-b2064656.html', 2, 'independent', 'Government finally step in after football proves it cannot run itself', 'The Football Association still believes that it can fulfil the role of the game’s independent regulator even as the government takes the next step to establish a new framework of governance for the sport. Last year, Tracey Crouch’s fan-led review made 10 recommendations aimed at improving football and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has confirmed that a white paper endorsing the findings will be published this summer. This is the first step towards pushing legislation through Parliament.  The main proposal in the review was the introduction of a regulator with the ability to sanction teams that break financial rules and the powers to protect the identity and sustainability of clubs. The FA’s conviction that it can remain as the primary ruling body emanates from the government’s position that the problems highlighted in Crouch’s review should be “solved by the football authorities in the first instance.” A source close to the situation last night described the FA’s position as “delusional.” The regulator will also have the capability to implement an “enhanced” owners’ and directors’ test across the game. The acquisition of Newcastle United by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and the sanctioning of Roman Abramovich and the subsequent sale of Chelsea have shown the importance of tighter scrutiny of potential owners. The government announcement is short on detail about how a stricter test would be applied but says the integrity appraisal would exist on an “ongoing basis.” This will ring alarm bells at the Premier League. The top-flight’s ruling body is stridently against regulation. The organisation engaged Helen MacNamara, who was director general for propriety and ethics at the Cabinet Office from 2018 to 2020, to help plead its case to Downing Street. MacNamara was one of the first officials to be given a fixed penalty fine in the ‘Partygate’ scandal and has been unable to influence policy makers. Last month she told a DCMS committee that the Premier League was “definitely” against a regulator.  The English Football League, by contrast, is happy with developments. Rick Parry, the chairman, was one of the driving forces behind Project Big Picture, the plan to redistribute wealth across the pyramid. That initiative failed but financial distribution and solidarity payments are slated to come under the microscope of the regulator if the game cannot sort itself out. The white paper will also address the involvement of supporters in the future of clubs. One of the proposals is for a ‘shadow board’ to give fans a voice in the running of the business. A ‘golden share’ is likely to be introduced, ensuring that any changes to kits, badges and stadiums are acceptable to a fanbase to protect the position of clubs as community assets. One senior football administrator said last night that “you’d expect more substance,” given that Crouch’s review was published last year. What constitutes a potentially “unscrupulous” owner is open to question. Despite the FA’s belief that it can fulfil the government’s role, a completely new regulatory entity is the likeliest outcome. The failed European Super League venture – following on from the Project Big Picture furore – has convinced Whitehall that football cannot adequately run itself. The attempts by the game’s competing bodies to come to a reasonable revenue-sharing compromise have failed. There has been little or no progress on a more equitable financial landscape since the collapse of the Super League enterprise last year. There is scant confidence in the political arena that football can get its house in order. The small positive the Premier League can take from this latest announcement is that it offers a last chance for them to drive a fairer redistribution of wealth. The gap between the stance of the top-flight clubs and those of the EFL may be too wide to bridge, though. The government also said it was planning a review of the women’s game with the intention of widening its appeal. The findings are scheduled to be made public by the end of the year.

(925, '/sport/football/liverpool-divock-origi-everton-klopp-b2064616.html', 2, 'independent', 'The joy of Origi, Liverpool’s ‘legend’ and Everton’s chief tormentor', 'These may be the last days in the age of Divock. It has been an improbable era with an unpromising beginning. It has become a golden time for Liverpool. And, indeed, for a man who Jurgen Klopp has come to call “the legend.” Not many legends are the sixth-choice forward. Then again, even at the home of the original super-sub, there have not been too many cult heroes quite like Divock Origi. There is a temptation to suggest that, before picking the all-time Liverpool XI, it makes sense to name David Fairclough and Origi on the bench. They have been the specialist rescuers and, when it seemed as though Everton’s obduracy might hinder their neighbours’ title challenge, Klopp knew where to turn. Enter Origi. Some 35 minutes later, they shared a hug in the centre circle. Two minutes after his introduction and with his first touch, Origi was the meat in the sandwich of a one-two with Mohamed Salah, who crossed for Andy Robertson to head in. Victory was sealed by an Origi header. His sixth Merseyside derby goal may be his last: because he could go and perhaps, if Everton are relegated, their nemesis may have made himself redundant. He has spent years exacting revenge on them for Ramiro Funes Mori’s awful challenge in 2016, when he suffered ankle ligament damage. When he trotted on to torment them again, there was an inevitability but also a certain nostalgia. He was already revisiting his past. It can feel ludicrous that only Steven Gerrard has scored more Premier League goals in Merseyside derbies than Origi. In this, as in Liverpool’s history, he is the likeable everyman in the company of the greats. Perhaps he is often underestimated: he seems to bound on with enthusiasm yet somehow makes things happen. There may be many forwards with more quality, but few with his skills as a catalyst. Origi celebrates his goal to clinch the points at Anfield  “He was again very decisive,” said Klopp. That is a skill in itself. His manager argued he has others. Salah has scored 155 goals for him, Sadio Mane 116, Roberto Firmino 98 and Origi 41. Klopp nevertheless insisted he is the best at putting the ball in the back of the net. He explained: “He is fantastic footballer for me, he is a world-class striker, our best finisher, he always was and everyone would say the same when you see him do these kind of things in training.” Part of the joy of Origi, however, has long been the perception that he wasn’t world class or anything remotely close. Rather, he was the endearing understudy who destroyed Barcelona in a Champions League semi-final and, for good measure, scored a Champions League final goal. From Everton in 2018 to Newcastle in 2019 to Wolves in 2021, he can be the master of the late goal. “Everybody loves Div and rightly so,” said Klopp. “He is a legend on and off the pitch.” Divock Origi of Liverpool celebrates with Trent Alexander-Arnold and Mohamed Salah after scoring at Molineux Increasingly, he is off the pitch. These were his first Premier League minutes for two months. He hasn’t started a league game all season. He has played just 102 of Liverpool’s 2970 top-flight minutes; small workload, big impact. “He doesn’t always make the squad which is ridiculous, but he is there when we need him every time,” said Klopp, the man who makes those ridiculous decisions. It is in part because of Liverpool’s greater strength in depth. Origi’s greatest feats came when he was the first reserve to Klopp’s definitive front three. Then Diogo Jota pushed him down the pecking order. Then Luis Diaz did likewise. If Origi was Liverpool’s ideal 12th man, there are times when he is in effect the 21st, the super-sub who is not even a substitute. It is a reason why he could go in the summer when his contract is up, in search of the first-team football that has eluded him. Klopp is bemused Liverpool did not receive offers last summer: perhaps Origi was pigeonholed as a big-club substitute by those looking for a starter for a mid-table club. Many of them don’t need anyone to terrorise Barcelona because they will never play Barcelona. Klopp has both given him a bit-part role and sounded like his greatest champion. “He will explode wherever he goes,” he said. Time and again, Origi and Liverpool have had a blast.

(926, '/sport/football/man-utd-arsenal-rangnick-ten-hag-b2064000.html', 2, 'independent', 'Man Utd’s ‘disaster’ of a dressing room finding problems at every turn', 'While Mikel Arteta was enthusiastically talking about the “belief” that such wins bring for Arsenal, Ralf Rangnick was left discussing the lack of it within the Manchester United dressing room. The German had been asked whether it is difficult to keep motivating this squad, given the situation, given the season. As is Rangnick’s nature - and as the United hierarchy have found out in the last few weeks - he can’t help being blunt. “Yes, quite obviously it’s hard to motivate and keep the energy level high. It was important to show some reaction today but there’s no substitute for success and it would have been very good for us and the level of confidence for the team.” Instead, any enthusiasm that came from Erik ten Hag’s appointment quickly evaporated. United were actually behind within three minutes. They are now virtually certain to be out of next season’s Champions League, as Rangnick admitted. “You look at the table, Tottenham and Arsenal, it’s not very realistic to dream and talk about top four.” It should be yet another wake-up call for United, of course, in a season full of them. While Arteta was left to talk about that huge 12 May showdown at Tottenham Hotspur with a glint in his eye, the excitement of being involved in such an occasion, this United squad are left to drift. And that’s a squad, it should be remembered, that is one of the most expensive ever assembled. What a waste. It has all added up to a dysfunctional and disaffected group. Paul Scholes had seemed to drop Jesse Lingard in it by admitting on international television that the midfielder had told him the dressing room is a “disaster”. Rangnick was asked about this and couldn’t even really bring himself to deny it. His response was, at best, qualified. “I think the whole group get on reasonably with each other, I\'m not daring to say they get on well with each other. I don\'t see there is an issue in regard to the locker room.” There is certainly no issue in Arsenal’s dressing room right now. They are almost the anti-United in that regard. They have gone through the bloodletting process. While they do not have United’s expensive stars, or that ceiling of talent, it means they have a cohesive and united group. That does matter on occasions like today, and this run-in. It could be seen in the celebration after Granit Xhaka’s thunderous winner. Everyone was so happy for him. A player that had looked like he could be drummed out of Arsenal had instead represented an example of how you can turn it around. He could even serve as an inspiration for United players in that regard, because so many are facing up to uncertain futures. So many have to prove they should be kept on. Many others have no interest in staying on. This is why Rangnick’s statement that they could sign up to 10 players were no idle words. The Independent has been told that Ten Hag told the United hierarchy they could do with almost an entire XI in terms of improving the level of the squad. Rangnick has backed this up, and he does not think all that many are up to the standard. Some players are out regardless. Jesse Lingard, Paul Pogba and Edison Cavani are all on free transfers, with no interest in new deals. United themselves have been considering another free agent, in Antonio Rudiger. If so, they would be well behind Real Madrid in that race. But that sums up something else. United have signed a £30m-plus centre-back in four of the last five summers, and they’re still looking for another. Little wonder it’s hard to believe whatever next is the solution. There are problems at every turn. For Arsenal, having gone through the other side of all this, there is only a sense of progress.

(930, '/sport/football/man-city-oleksandr-zinchenko-real-madrid-b2064258.html', 2, 'independent', 'City need more Zinchenkos as lack of squad depth bites', 'Moments of genuine jeopardy were few and far between for Manchester City during their five-star rout of Watford on Saturday but there was one instance when it briefly appeared as though Roy Hodgson’s side could make their way back into the game. While the score was still 1-0, Joao Cancelo’s uncharacteristically careless use of possession sprang a Watford counter-attack. Emmanuel Dennis was running through one-on-one, albeit from close to half-way with a lot of ground to make up. Dennis made it to the edge of the box and was about to pull the trigger when the ball was swept out from his feet. Oleksandr Zinchenko had already set up Gabriel Jesus’ opening goal. Now, he had prevented what almost certainly would be a Watford equaliser. Those were the two early highlights of an all-round performance at left-back that Pep Guardiola would later describe as “absolutely exceptional”. And of course, it is arguably remarkable that Zinchenko is playing at all, never mind playing well. Football has been a welcome and necessary distraction for a young man whose life outside the game has been consumed by the invasion of his country. “I can’t live outside this situation,” he recently told The Guardian. “Trying to follow everything is basically my life. The first thing I do every day is reach for my phone, and then it’s in my hand constantly.” “It’s not been an easy period for Aleks,” Guardiola said. “What happened in his country with his loved ones - people forget about Ukraine, now we don\'t talk about it any more, there\'s no flags for Ukraine - but Aleks is living it every day.” It would be understandable if Zinchenko’s focus had wavered or even if his commitment in training had dropped over the past two months, but that is the last thing that Guardiola has come to expect from a player who has had to prove himself more than most in the City squad. “It’s another occasion where the way he plays, the quality, the assist, he\'s always focused, always concentrating,” Zinchenko’s manager said of his performance against Watford. “He’s incredibly appreciated in the locker room.” Manchester City’s focus returns to the Champions League this week against Real Madrid And as City’s quest for domestic and European dominance enters its final stage, Zinchenko’s presence is appreciated even more than usual. Ahead of Tuesday’s semi-final first leg against Real Madrid, City are short at full-back. Cancelo is suspended. Kyle Walker is an injury doubt. John Stones, who has deputised as a right-back, could also be sidelined. Combine this quick and concentrated spate of injuries with Guardiola’s preference for a small, tightly-knit squad and it is easy to see how problems arise. There is not a fit and available natural first-team full-back at the club. “We don\'t have many options,” Guardiola admitted on Saturday. “We don\'t have full-backs.” City do have Zinchenko, though. Upon his unheralded arrival in a £2million deal with Ufa, he was an attacking midfielder - “a No 10, a Phil Foden,” as Guardiola recalls - but first team opportunities in his preferred role were always likely to be limited. They are still limited for him as left-back. “There are periods where other players are better, more confident and he plays less,” his manager admitted. Yet Zinchenko’s dedication and determination to forge a role for himself has meant that he is a valued and integral part of City’s small squad, just 17 established first-teamers deep. He is exactly the type of utility option that Guardiola needs but lacks, the type that he has struggled to hold onto despite his enthusiasm for rotation. There is a constant tension at City over playing time. It was Ferran Torres earlier this season. Aymeric Laporte was not happy with his minutes last year. Leroy Sané left with similar misgivings. Raheem Sterling has voiced concerns. Guardiola understands all their frustrations, and sympathised with four-goal hero Jesus on Saturday over his lack of starts, but can offer no guarantees. Zinchenko has never complained, though. He has got on with the task, even if it is ill-suited to him. “You are an incredible journalist,” Guardiola told one reporter asking about the Ukrainian, “and one day we ask you to be a photographer. You say yes you will do it but being a photographer for three years will be a problem. But he will do it every single day.” That is invaluable in a small squad at City’s, especially when there is a queue outside the treatment room. Guardiola would have no concerns about selecting Zinchenko in a role closer to his natural position, or even as one of the more reserved central midfielders in his system if circumstances insisted upon it. He needs more players like him, not fewer. If City fall short in either the Premier League title race or fail to win their first Champions League, a lack of squad depth will be identified as one of their vulnerabilities. But if they do achieve either, despite this mini-injury crisis, then Zinchenko’s ability to fill in at full-back will have played an important part in their success. He may still have a bigger role to play too. “Who knows who will help us win the Premier League or reach the final of the Champions League?”, Guardiola said. “Everyone thinks they know – but sometimes it can be one who you don’t expect. That’s why everyone has to be ready and the glory will belong to them.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(931, '/sport/football/liverpool-everton-result-anthony-gordon-penalty-b2064438.html', 2, 'independent', 'Lampard claims Everton get given Gordon penalty if he was Salah', 'Frank Lampard said Everton should have had a penalty in their Merseyside derby defeat and argued it would have been given had Mohamed Salah gone down in the box at Anfield, rather than Anthony Gordon. Winger Gordon, who had already been booked for diving, was nudged over by Joel Matip, eight minutes before Andy Robertson scored the opener in Liverpool’s 2-0 win. It leaves Everton in the relegation zone for the first time this season while Lampard, citing his experience during his playing days with Chelsea, claimed decisions tend to go the way of top clubs. The Everton manager said: “It was a penalty. If that was Mo Salah at the other end, he gets a penalty. You don’t get them here. That’s the reality of football sometimes.” Lampard had decided against approaching referee Stuart Attwell after the final whistle to discuss the decision: “I think they are open to it now but it is gone,” he said. “It is a disappointment, in the cold light of day I think it is a penalty.” Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp disagreed with the Englishman and claimed Gordon was fortunate to stay on the pitch, saying: “It [the second] was clearly no penalty. He’s really good but he’s lucky not to get a second yellow. The first was not a penalty and the second wasn’t.” Everton denied Liverpool a shot on target in the opening hour but Lampard urged his players to build on their performance as he vowed not to admit defeat in their battle against the drop. “I’m proud and happy with the performance,” he added. “We have to take that spirit forward to the final games. The result is [disappointing] but the performance isn’t. I’m very pleased and proud of the work ethic. We didn’t get the clinical finishes at 0-0. We’ll give everything until the end.” Everton lost defender Ben Godfrey with a quad muscle injury in the warm-up. “I am hoping it is minor,” Lampard said.

(932, '/sport/football/government-rick-parry-premier-league-english-super-league-b2064626.html', 2, 'independent', 'Fair Game wants ‘a firm timetable’ to implement fan-led review points', 'A reform group has warned “there can be no more delay or dithering” on implementing football’s fan-led review. The government will formally respond to the review later on Monday but has already indicated it endorses the review’s strategic recommendations. These include the creation of an independent regulator, greater consultation with fans via shadow boards, additional protections for key items of club heritage and fairer distribution of money from the top of the game down the football pyramid. But there is uncertainty over when any meaningful change may come, with no timetable in place to get the legislation needed to underpin the regulator. Niall Couper, the chief executive of Fair Game, a group which campaigns for the reform of the English game, said: “The announcement at last offers a real opportunity to save football. “The argument for an independent regulator is now over. There is huge cross-party political support for it and the ideas put forward by Fair Game and the fan-led review. “What we need now is a firm timetable for change. There can be no more delay or dithering. “If reform is allowed to be kicked into the long grass, it will represent the death knell to the hard-working clubs at the centre of our towns and communities. “The financial situation at most clubs is perilous. For too long the challenges in our national game have been booted down the road by the football authorities and successive governments putting our clubs on the edge of ruin. “Let’s end the culture of gambling that has seen clubs spend more than they earn, a culture that sidelines the views of fans, pays no more than lip service to equality standards, and is devoid of any financial scrutiny. “Legislation has the power to change football and protect our community clubs for the generations to come.” For too long the challenges in our national game have been booted down the road by the football authorities and successive governments putting our clubs on the edge of ruin. The review was commissioned a year ago, brought forward by the government in the wake of the Super League scandal, with the review panel’s recommendations published last November. The government endorses the review’s call for fairer distribution of Premier League broadcast revenue to the rest of the pyramid, but still wants football’s authorities to come up with a solution rather than imposing one if possible. The Premier League and EFL have shown no sign of reaching one and the government is open to the idea of giving the regulator backstop powers to enforce a solution. Couper added: “The football authorities must now grow up and create a financial system that rewards hard-working community clubs and stops giving money to failed Premier League clubs through parachute payments. “We need a sustainability index. A system which grades clubs according to how they score on four criteria – financial sustainability, good governance, equality standards and fan and community engagement. The higher they score the more money they get.” Couper said it was “disappointing” that the government’s initial release did not mention the levy on international transfers talked about in the review as one method to raise extra revenue for the pyramid.

(933, '/sport/football/wsl-chelsea-arsenal-results-tottenham-everton-b2064482.html', 2, 'independent', 'Chelsea come from behind to beat Spurs as Arsenal keep up the pressure', 'Women’s Super League leaders Chelsea came from behind to earn a vital 3-1 win at Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday while second-placed Arsenal kept up the pressure with a 3-0 win away to Everton in the evening kickoff. Chelsea, who had a one-point lead over second-placed Arsenal coming into the game, went behind early through a Sophie Ingle own goal in the 15th minute before Guro Reiten levelled with a left-footed finish from a tight angle 12 minutes later. Chelsea keeper Ann-Katrin Berger was sent off before the break for a challenge on Rachel Williams but the champions managed to grab a second goal when Sam Kerr turned in a Jonna Andersson cross in the 71st minute, and Jessie Fleming added a late third to briefly open up a four-point lead over Arsenal. The Gunners closed that gap quickly, with Beth Mead and Jordan Nobbs both netting their 50th WSL goals en route to a comfortable win over Everton to move to 46 points with three games left to play. Manchester City cruised to a 4-0 victory over second-from-bottom Leicester City as first-half goals from Caroline Weir, Lauren Hemp and Julie Blakstad gave them a commanding home win against Leicester, with Alex Greenwood adding a fourth from the spot to complete the rout. That result boosted fourth-placed City’s hopes of Champions League football next season as rivals Manchester United were held to a scoreless draw by Aston Villa. United are third on 39 points, one ahead of City having played a game more. It also had an effect on the relegation battle, with bottom side Birmingham City’s 3-1 win away to Brighton & Hove Albion on Saturday helping them close the gap to Leicester to four points with three games left to play, one more than the Foxes. The bottom side at the end of the season will be relegated to the Championship. Elsewhere Emma Snerle and Yui Hasegawa were on target as West Ham United secured a 2-1 win over Reading, who netted a late consolation through Faye Bryson. West Ham are sixth with 27 points, three ahead of eighth-placed Reading.

(934, '/sport/football/karim-benzema-real-madrid-watford-gabriel-jesus-atletico-madrid-b2064505.html', 2, 'independent', 'Man City refreshed and ready for Real Madrid after Watford thrashing', 'Midfielder Rodri believes Manchester City’s thrashing of Watford was just the tonic needed heading into this week’s clash with Real Madrid. City looked heavy-legged against Brighton in midweek after a draining previous fortnight in which they played both Atletico Madrid and Liverpool twice. They were far more sprightly as they crushed the Hornets 5-1 at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday, hardly looking back after Gabriel Jesus claimed the first of his four goals in the fourth minute. Rodri, who hit the other goal in stunning fashion, feels the Premier League leaders are now in good shape for the first leg of their Champions League semi-final against Spanish giants Real on Tuesday. “You have these games – Liverpool-Atletico-Liverpool-Atletico – and it is so demanding,” said the Spain international. “At the end of this period you are a little bit… ‘phew’. You need to breathe a little bit. “We now face Real Madrid in the best moment and we’ll see. We know exactly how they play. This is a team that, of course, have the experience of the competition and wait for their opportunity. “They are not consistent over 90 minutes but are always dangerous. We have to be aware. The first game is here at home so we have to do our best but – the way I saw our team in this match – I’m not worried. “Maybe after the FA Cup match (against Liverpool) I felt the team were a bit weak and tired, but not in this game. It makes me hope the team is going to be good.” One player certain to test City is Real’s prolific forward Karim Benzema, who has netted 39 goals in 40 matches this season including four across both legs of the quarter-final victory over Chelsea. Rodri said: “He is in the best moment of his career. He understands every part of the game and is scoring goals, important goals. “I would say, ‘f****** hell’, this guy is amazing in every game, and he not only scores goals but makes his team feel comfortable with the ball. “He is a great player but it is not only him. We have to be aware of all of Real Madrid.” City manager Pep Guardiola has called on fans to give the players an extra push in the first leg at the Etihad Stadium. Guardiola said: “I ask our people, our fans, if they have nothing more interesting to do – come on, take a train, a bus, a car and come and be with us. “It is special. For this club it is only the third time in the semi-final of the Champions League against a team who have a lot of Champions League trophies in the cabinet. “It has to be a special night for us, give everything we have in our soul and enjoy it.” Jesus also brushed off questions about his future to turn his full focus to the game. The Brazil striker had been the subject of speculation following strong reports linking City with a move for Borussia Dortmund striker Erling Haaland. Jesus said: “This is no time to think about this. “Now is the best moment of the season. I want to enjoy, to keep focused on my team. We have the tough, tough game on Tuesday against Real Madrid and that is my focus.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

Barcelona were also eliminated from the Europa League earlier this month. “We were all fired up with the great run in the league and the Europa League,” Xavi told reporters. “I understand it’s not as motivating for the fans and players to fight for second place. But we have to be in the Champions League, we want to hear the Champions League music next season. “There is a lot at stake. In Barcelona’s history it’s about coming first, but we have to understand and motivate ourselves to finish second.” Barca next host Mallorca on Sunday.

Pulisic’s 90th-minute winner at Stamford Bridge made up for his team mate Jorginho’s missed penalty as Chelsea remained third in the league on 65 points, five points above fourth-placed Arsenal, who have played a game more. Pulisic’s playing time has been limited in recent weeks, with the American last starting in their 3-1 defeat at home to Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals on April 6. “It was a massive goal. We had so much pressure on them for most of the game but we couldn’t get that breakthrough, so I am happy I was able to help out,” said Pulisic, who replaced Timo Werner in the 76th minute. “I needed to come in and make a difference, prove I want to be playing and I am happy I did that.” It was Pulisic’s first goal since he scored in their Champions League last-16 match at Lille on March 16. “I always want to be on the pitch, to help my team and I am glad I got the opportunity today,” he added. “We played a good match and we got our deserved goal in the end.” Chelsea next travel to face Manchester United in the league on Thursday.

The Egypt midfielder’s current deal expires at the end of the season and he looked all set for the Emirates Stadium exit door after six and a half years. However, an unexpected recall has seen the 29-year-old shine in vital wins over Chelsea and Manchester United which have revitalised Arsenal’s quest for a top-four Premier League finish. His selection at Stamford Bridge was his first club appearance since December and he has made just six starts all season – including three in the Carabao Cup. But Elneny is the longest-serving Arsenal player currently at the club and is keen to extend his association with the Gunners, even if he continues to be a bit-part player under Mikel Arteta. Asked if he would be happy to stay even if not playing, the former Basel man replied: “Of course. “I always love a challenge and give 100 per cent all the time. I don’t decide who plays but I keep going in training to show how good I am and to make him play me. I don\'t think about leaving. It\'s my family for six years. I love this club. “If I don’t play I keep going until I get my chance. If Arsenal say ‘we want you’ I don’t think about leaving. It’s my family for six years. I love this club.” Elneny spent the 2019/20 season on loan at Besiktas and a return to Turkey was on the cards in January, only for Arteta to convince Elneny to stay put. The Arsenal boss hailed him as “one of the most important players in the squad” ahead of the victory over United and Elneny is pleased with the relationship he has with Arteta. “He didn’t say anything (to persuade Elneny to stay in January),” he added. “He just trusts me and he put me in the big games. And I have to thank him for that. “I will keep going and not think about anything else, just focus on my performances to help the team reach our goal. The contract and stuff, I’m just waiting for the club to decide what they want. “Mikel is always really close to all the players. We always talk together and he gives us confidence all the time. “He gives us the chance to play games and the most important thing is that he trusts his players. “I’m really happy to be one of the starting XI for these two games. I gave everything in training to be one of the starting XI every game and I got my chance and I think I did well. Most importantly, we won the two games.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(938, '/sport/football/patrick-vieira-jesse-marsch-premier-league-new-york-red-bulls-major-league-soccer-b2', 2, 'independent', 'Vieira does not see Marsch as rival ahead of Premier League clash', 'Crystal Palace manager Patrick Vieira has insisted he does not view Leeds boss Jesse Marsch as a rival ahead of Monday night’s Premier League fixture between the two clubs. Vieira and Marsch faced each other nine times when they were in charge of New York City and New York Red Bulls respectively, before they both took the decision to bid farewell to Major League Soccer in 2018 to move to Europe and are now subsequently together again in the English top flight. Derby games between City and Red Bulls were fiery, with Vieira hitting out at Marsch for “crying” once – but tensions have simmered since they left the United States. “It was the atmosphere around those games and the fans, but there was nothing really like a rivalry between Jesse and myself,” stressed Vieira. “It is difficult for me to talk about him (personally). But as a manager, look at what he has achieved at Red Bulls, I think he did a fantastic job there. He is a manager who deserves respect and credit for what he achieved and for what he has been doing to get where he is now.” Marsch’s appointment at the end of February sparked talk of Ted Lasso, the American in charge of a British team in a docuseries popular in the UK. The new Leeds head coach admitted it does little to improve the perception of coaches from the States. Vieira added: “It was the same before with the French managers or French players. Gerard Houllier came, Arsene (Wenger) came and did fantastically well and that gave credibility to the rest of the French managers and the players. “It was the same when (Eric) Cantona came and (suddenly) French players can adapt to the league and that opened the door for the rest of us. “I think when managers from abroad come into the league and do well, they show any manager can do well.” Palace boss Vieira can empathise with Marsch over the scrutiny initially placed on the former Red Bulls chief when he replaced Marcelo Bielsa at Elland Road. Three wins from their last four games has quietened the external noise, which the Eagles manager also faced upon his appointment in the summer. “I listened to it and it is something that doesn’t bother me,” Vieira commented of his detractors. “I believe in myself and the people around me to support me and it’s about concentrating and focusing on what I want to do as a manager and a coach. “The coaching team is massive, the support of the chairman (Steve Parish) and Dougie (Freedman) is massively important. There is a really good communication between the football club that allowed me to express myself as a manager.” It has been a positive season for Palace given they recently enjoyed a trip to Wembley and have managed to stay well clear of the relegation zone despite this being termed as a transitional campaign. With six games left, there are club targets to try to achieve but Vieira could also look to the future and try to blood some of his talented younger players. Academy graduates Tayo Adaramola and Jesurun Rak-Sakyi are pushing for more minutes. Vieira admitted: “We have a good idea of their potential. “They spend a lot of time with the first team and played some games but we need to test them. ‘When’ is the question, but we need to see what they are capable of doing. “Jes is a special talent and has the potential to perform at a high level but we need to create a pathway to take him to the next step. Maybe with us or on loan, but it is too early to make that decision.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(939, '/sport/football/david-moyes-west-ham-declan-rice-premier-league-londoners-b2064382.html', 2, 'independent', 'Moyes insists West Ham won’t panic over Rice’s contract situation', 'David Moyes has insisted West Ham will not panic over Declan Rice’s future. Rice is understood to have rejected West Ham’s third offer of a new contract, amid continued negotiations over a deal at the London Stadium club. The 23-year-old is contracted until 2024, with West Ham holding the option of extending that deal by another 12 months. Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea have tracked Rice consistently, with the Premier League’s top sides still eyeing a transfer. But West Ham boss Moyes insisted the east Londoners have more pressing matters on their hands, given Rice’s contract situation. When asked for his opinion on Rice rejecting West Ham’s latest offer, Moyes replied: “We certainly didn’t say that. Unless you’ve got who said it then I can’t say it. We’ve not answered it really have we. “I’ve said it and I think we have said what we think. We like Dec and he’s got three and a half years to go on his contract so I don’t think there is any big panic. We\'ve got three and a half years so it isn\'t the biggest priority “We’ve got three and a half years so it isn’t the biggest priority. We’ve got other priorities, trying to add to the squad and get other positions in. “Maybe he just wants more money. People do turn down contracts. It is not unusual for players at clubs to turn down contracts, maybe it is a negotiation tactic.” West Ham lost out 1-0 at Chelsea with Christian Pulisic netting a last-minute winner to stun the Hammers. Lukasz Fabianski saved Jorginho’s penalty with four minutes to play, but West Ham could not hold on after seeing Craig Dawson sent off for fouling Romelu Lukaku to concede the penalty. Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel confirmed that Toni Rudiger will leave the Blues this summer, with Real Madrid poised to wrap up a deal for the Germany defender. When asked if the fact even Chelsea cannot retain Rudiger’s services just shows that football’s financial pressures are growing tougher than ever, Moyes replied: “The difference is that he, Rudiger, is out of contract. We’ve got three and a half years to go. That is the difference. “I sold Wayne Rooney and Everton got better. It doesn’t always mean that things don’t happen. We’ve said before that we’ve got no intention of selling so I don’t know why you keep asking.” A much-changed West Ham so nearly held on for a creditable point, with Moyes protecting a clutch of tired players for next week’s Europa League semi-final first leg at Eintracht Frankfurt. Moyes was pleased with his players’ attitude and organisation, but admitted he thought Dawson could have dealt with the danger ahead of conceding the penalty. Moyes said: “We had hung in for long periods in the game. The penalty went in our favour with the save, and we just had to see out the last five, 10 minutes with 10 men. “The defeat’s a little bit undeserved, but we didn’t defend well enough in those last four, five minutes. So that’s it. “I thought Craig he played ever so well, but I still think he should have got to the ball and cleared it with his left foot. “But he didn’t and he gave the referee a decision to make, and today it went against us.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

The i says factions on the Conservative back benches are working in a more synchronised manner to remove the prime minister over the Partygate scandal. “They are working together more now,” one source told the paper. “One Nation and 2019 Tory MPs are more coordinated.” It comes as Mr Johnson comes under increasing pressure over Covid law-breaking in Downing Street. A separate report in The Times said a Whitehall investigation into the scandal could be so damning for the PM that he could be left with no option but to resign. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson was forced to condemn “misogyny” from his own party after deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner accused Tory MPs of using anonymous briefings to spread “desperate, perverted smears”. Sir Keir Starmer has insisted the whole culture of Parliament must change after the treatment of Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, claiming: “It’s sexist, it’s misogynist”. Our politics correspondent Ashley Cowburn has the full story:  ‘It’s rank sexism, rank misogyny,’ Labour leader says  The Tory MP who made misogynist comments about Angela Rayner could face “serious consequences” if they are identified, a government minister has said. Chris Philp, the technology minister, spoke to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme earlier. He said: “I think that if anyone is identified having views like those that were expressed, which are just outrageous and misogynistic, then I would expect serious consequences to follow. “I expect efforts will be made to identify who is responsible for those views. But journalists fiercely guard their sources and I doubt Glen Owen will be volunteering that information. “I think there is ongoing, active work to make sure anyone holding offensive views, including the misogyny we saw demonstrated over the weekend, is called out and action is taken.” Fewer than 200 asylum seekers would be deported to Rwanda under existing immigration rules, a new analysis shows, casting doubt over Boris Johnson’s claim that “tens of thousands” would be removed under the plan. Our social affairs correspondent May Bulman has the story:   New figures cast doubt over Boris Johnson’s claim that tens of thousands will be removed under new deal  Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for an end to the “misogynist” culture at Westminster after his deputy Angela Rayner was accused of trying to distract Boris Johnson at Prime Minister’s Questions. Sir Keir told ITV’s This Morning there would be “zero tolerance” for such attitudes in his own party. “It is rank sexism, rank misogyny. She was really disgusted that all of her political attributes were put aside for this ridiculous, offensive story,” he said. “She shouldn’t have to put up with it but all women in politics shouldn’t have to put up with it. Almost every woman in politics has had an element of this in some shape or form. “We have got to change the culture. The culture in parliament, it is sexist, it is misogynist. We need to change it. “That is what Angela said to me. She used this expression, she said ‘It triggered something in me about the way women are seen in politics.” He added: “I need to look at it within my own party wherever we see it. We will be absolutely on it with zero tolerance. There shouldn’t be a party political divide on this.” Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said she is \"pleased\" Jeremy Corbyn is not prime minister as she addressed criticism that Sir Keir Starmer is facing for being in the former Labour leader\'s shadow cabinet. Asked about whether it is a coincidence that she was never in Mr Corbyn\'s shadow cabinet, she told Times Radio: \"No, I stood down when Jeremy Corbyn became leader of the Labour Party. \"But I have huge respect for the work that that Keir did in Jeremy Corbyn\'s shadow cabinet on Brexit, and he also he consistently called out antisemitism. He always was a strong voice for Britain\'s membership of Nato in the shadow cabinet. \"And some people called out Jeremy Corbyn from the back benches, like me, and some people from the front benches, like Keir. \"But Keir has suspended Jeremy Corbyn from the parliamentary Labour Party, and as you said yesterday, (he) just doesn\'t see a way back for Mr Corbyn after not just the antisemitism, which is deplorable and which Keir is rooting out from our party, but also because of Mr Corbyn\'s views and language on Nato on this programme just last week.\" Former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has said the idea that Angela Rayner is distracting Boris Johnson during Prime Minister’s Questions is “laughable”, but provided an example of the “extreme misogyny” women in politics face. Ms Dugdale told BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme: “I think this is definitely a particularly egregious example, and the idea that Angela Rayner is defeating Boris Johnson’s Oxford-based debating skills with the power of her legs alone is just a nonsense, and it’s laughable, but it’s an example of the extreme misogyny that women face in politics every single day. “You’re just hearing about this particular example because Angela Rayner is senior enough to have power and agency to call it out and demand that there are consequences for what has happened. “But for a lot of women, they just have to quietly put up with comments like this on a day-by-day basis. “It’s really, really disappointing and kind of depressing that despite the increased levels of women’s representation we’ve got in politics across the United Kingdom, the culture hasn’t changed anywhere near to the extent that it should have.” Former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has said the idea that Angela Rayner is distracting Boris Johnson during Prime Minister’s Questions is “laughable”, but provided an example of the “extreme misogyny” women in politics face. Around four in ten people reported finding it hard to afford their energy bills last month, according to new ONS figures that document the rising cost of living crisis. My colleague Holly Bancroft will have more on this story as it comes in:  Around 9 in 10 adults reported an increase in the cost of living in March 2022  Tory rebels are working together to oust Boris Johnson after the local elections in May, according to a report. The i says factions on the Conservative back benches are working in a more synchronised manner to remove the prime minister over the Partygate scandal. “They are working together more now,” one source told the paper. “One Nation and 2019 Tory MPs are more coordinated.” A government minister has insisted there is “nothing surprising” about Boris Johnson and the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, using identical words in tweets expressing support with Angela Rayner. The comments from the culture minister, Chris Philp, came as politicians of all stripes condemned the misogynistic claims made about Labour’s deputy leader by an unidentified Conservative MP in the Mail on Sunday. Our politics correspondent Ashley Cowburn reports:  Minister adds he was ‘appalled by the sentiment being expressed’  Jacob Rees-Mogg has been accused of “bullying behaviour” and being “very old-fashioned” over telling civil servants to come back into the office. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said businesses are still “trying to get the balance right” after the pandemic, and the Civil Service needs to do the same, she said. “I think it will attract some really talented people if you don’t have to be in the office every day, and there’s lots of accountancy firms and banks and other businesses that are trying to get that balance right,” she told LBC Radio, adding: “I think this sort of bullying behaviour from the Brexit minister that says that people have got to be at their desks every day of the week and for every hour - it’s very old-fashioned.” It comes after images emerged of notes Mr Rees-Mogg left on civil servants’ desks in an effort to stop them working from home. The notes, complete with an official government crest, said: “Sorry you were out when I visited. I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon. With every good wish, Rt Hon Jacob Rees-Mogg MP.” He was called “condescending” as a result.

Addressing he the report, Sir Keir told ITV’s This Morning: “It’s rank sexism, rank misogyny.

He said it was “up to” the Conservative Party what action they could potentially take, but stressed: “I actually think it’s a culture thing and therefore going after one or two individuals isn’t enough. “We have got to change the culture. The culture in Parliament — it’s sexist, it’s misogynist and we need to change it. “That is what Angela said to me.

There shouldn’t be a party political divide on this.” In response to the story, Boris Johnson said: “As much as I disagree with Angela Rayner on almost every political issue I respect her as a parliamentarian and deplore the misogyny directed at her anonymously today”.

Ms Gray, a senior civil servant, was forced to delay the publication of her investigation into alleged parties held in Downing Street and Whitehall during England’s coronavirus lockdowns due to the Metropolitan Police commencing their own inquiry. In an interim report published in January, the Cabinet Office official said there had been “failures of leadership and judgment” in No 10 over the so-called partygate saga. The Times, citing an official it described as being familiar with the contents of the complete report, said Ms Gray’s full findings were even more personally critical of the prime minister and could end his premiership. According to the paper, the official said: “Sue’s report is excoriating. It will make things incredibly difficult for the Prime Minister. “There’s an immense amount of pressure on her — her report could be enough to end him.” No 10 declined to comment. It comes amid separate reports in the i newspaper that Conservative rebels are preparing to oust Mr Johnson in the event of a poor showing at the local elections next month or if further fines are issued to him. Police are continuing to investigate allegations of Covid breaches in No 10 Scotland Yard has already fined Mr Johnson, along with his wife Carrie and chancellor Rishi Sunak, for attending his 56th birthday bash held in June 2020 when Covid rules banned indoor gatherings. Downing Street is said to be braced for Mr Johnson to receive a second fixed-penalty notice (FPN) after police reportedly began issuing fines relating to a “bring your own bottle” drinks do in the No 10 garden on May 20, 2020. He reportedly attended half of the 12 gatherings being probed by police. Cabinet ministers on Sunday offered a defence of the prime minister, with Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden suggesting it was “quite a speculation” to predict Mr Johnson could be hit with more FPNs. He and Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg backed Mr Johnson to lead the Tories into the next general election, which is currently scheduled for no later than January 2025. Sue Gray has so far only published an interim report of her partygate probe Mr Dowden told Sky News there was a “very strong case for the prime minister remaining in office” despite mounting pressure from his own backbenches for him to quit. Senior backbenchers, including former minister Steve Baker, have put their head above the parapet in recent weeks to call for Mr Johnson to vacate Downing Street following his handling of the rule-breaking allegations. According to the i, the PM’s critics have begun working in a co-ordinated fashion and are “holding back” to wait for the local election results or for further FPNs to arrive in Mr Johnson’s inbox. The paper cited other reports that some rebels have prepared no confidence letters to be submitted en masse to the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs should the party take a battering at the polls on May 5. Mr Dowden has admitted that the council elections will be “challenging”.

Culture secretary Nadine Dorries accused Mr Rees-Mogg, the minister responsible for government efficiency, of a “Dickensian” approach to the issue. Mr Rees-Mogg has written to Cabinet ministers calling on them to issue a clear message to staff about a “rapid return to the office” and has been leaving notes in empty Whitehall workspaces with the message: “I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon.” The Times reported that Ms Dorries’ response was highly critical of Mr Rees-Mogg’s approach. Mr Rees-Mogg presented figures to Cabinet last week showing that some government departments were using as little as 25 per cent of office capacity in early April – the figure for Ms Dorries’ Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport was 43 per cent. Ms Dorries told him his letter to government departments brought to mind “images of burning tallow, rheumy eyes and Marley’s ghost” – a reference to Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol. She said: “There’s a whiff of something Dickensian about it. Why are we measuring bodies behind desks? Why aren’t we measuring productivity?” The two ministers have long disagreed about the need to return to places of work following the lifting of coronavirus restrictions. But the dispute between the two was “good natured”, one government source said.  Unions have objected to Mr Rees-Mogg’s approach, with warnings his stance is damaging civil service morale. Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union which represents senior civil servants, warned that “good people will leave and the civil service brand is trashed in a highly competitive employment market”. Mr Rees-Mogg used a Mail on Sunday article to warn that officials may lose the London weighting on their pay or see their jobs moved elsewhere if they were not at their desks. “Essentially, if people are not back in their office it will be fair to assume that the job does not need to be in London,” he said.

The PM, his chancellor Rishi Sunak and his wife Carrie Johnson were among the latest tranche of government staff members handed fixed penalty notice fines by the Metropolitan Police for breaking their own rules to stage parties during the Covid-19 pandemic. Both Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak have apologised and paid their fines, with Mr Johnson saying: “In all frankness at that time it did not occur to me that this might have been a breach of the rules. Of course, the police have found otherwise and I fully respect the outcome of their investigation.” But he brushed off calls for his resignation, saying: “I believe it’s my job to get on and deliver for the people of this country. That’s what I’m going to do.” However, as the first serving PM to be found to have broken the law, he has already come under intense pressure to resign from Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, from Tory backbencher Nigel Mills and from campaign groups like Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice. While Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey and shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves added their voices to the calls to quit on Wednesday morning and reports emerge that Mr Sunak was talked out of quitting, the PM’s defenders including transport secretary Grant Shapps and Lord Frost has insisted that he is “completely mortified” by developments and keen to make amends. Leading backbench critics of Mr Johnson such as Sir Roger Gale and Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross have, meanwhile, argued that it is “not the time” for Britain change leaders in light of the war raging in Ukraine. The No 10 drinks parties held in the midst of England’s coronavirus lockdowns remain the subject of the Met’s ongoing investigation and Whitehall mandarin Sue Gray has still yet to deliver her full report into what went on behind closed doors. Ms Gray did submit a 12-page “update” on “Partygate” in January, which was heavily-redacted at the request of the Met, in which the civil servant blasted “failures of leadership and judgement” in Downing Street and the Cabinet Office, describing the behaviour of some personnel as “difficult to justify”. In a scathing comment on the culture at No 10 under Mr Johnson’s leadership, the senior civil servant wrote: “Some of the gatherings in question represent a serious failure to observe not just the high standards expected of those working at the heart of government but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time.” Her report also revealed that the PM’s birthday celebration was among a dozen gatherings being investigated by Scotland Yard, as was an alleged party in his private flat.  Addressing the House of Commons on 31 January after the report’s publication before an accrimonious gathering of MPs, the PM said he “accepts Sue Gray’s general findings in full” and “above all her recommendation that we must learn from these events and act now”. He said he was “sorry for the things we simply didn’t get right and also sorry for the way that this matter has been handled”. “I get it, and I will fix it,” he added. “I want to say to the people of this country I know what the issue is. It is whether this government can be trusted to deliver, and I say ‘yes we can be trusted to deliver’.” Before Christmas, Mr Johnson – who won a landslide victory in the December 2019 general election just prior to the onset of the pandemic – faced intense pressure over what became known as Partygate, a series of allegations concerning a string of social events that appear to have taken place over the course of 2020 in contempt for the rules in place at the time. These included leaving do’s for seniors aides Lee Cain (13 November) and Cleo Watson (27 November) and a series of departmental Christmas parties the following month, including one at which former Conservative London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey was pictured (14 December) and the virtual festive quiz in which the PM himself took part via Zoom (15 December). When a video emerged showing the PM’s staff laughing and joking about having hosted a secret Christmas party during the 2020 winter lockdown, a scandal that prompted the tearful resignation of his spokesperson, Allegra Stratton, Mr Johnson said he he was “sickened” at the prospect of Downing Street employees ignoring social restrictions. But early in the New Year, Mr Johnson found himself sidestepping questions about whether he personally attended an event on 20 May. ITV News had reported that the PM’s principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, had invited over 100 people by email to a “bring your own booze” bash in the grounds of his boss’s Westminster residence that day “to make the most of the lovely weather”. At the time of the alleged gathering, strict controls on social mixing were in place, prohibiting households from intermingling, schools were shut to most pupils and pubs, restaurants, nightclubs, sports stadia, cinemas and theatres were all closed. So strict were the rules at the time that police prosecuted people for having parties in their own homes, erected random checkpoints in some areas and, in Derbyshire, used drones to monitor beauty spots in the interest of shutting down illicit picnics. Police forces in England and Wales issued 14,244 fines for breaches of lockdown laws between 27 March and 11 May 2020, according to figures from the National Police Chiefs’ Council, also breaking up political demonstrations and social meet-ups in open areas like Hyde Park in central London in the interest of stopping the spread of the virus. An hour before the gathering in question is understood to have taken place, Cabinet minister Oliver Dowden had told members of the public via a live news conference about the Covid-19 outbreak: “You can meet one person outside your household in an outdoor, public place, provided that you stay two metres apart.” People would not be allowed to meet outside in groups of six until 1 June. Nevertheless, Mr Johnson and his then-partner (now wife) were among 30-40 people alleged to have attended the garden party in blithe indifference to the hardships the electorate were enduring, having responded to Mr Reynolds’ cheery invite email. A source told The Independent the PM had indeed “hung out” with staff for at least an hour as they knocked back drinks. Not all recipients were so keen to attend, however, with one staff member responding “Is this for real?” Another, according to the BBC, texted: “Um. Why is Martin [Reynolds] encouraging a mass gathering in the garden?” Boris Johnson apologises to the House of Commons over ‘Partygate’ on 31 January 2022  The bash was scheduled just five days after another cheese-and-wine social reportedly took place in the same venue, an event that was also part of Ms Gray’s investigation (she was appointed replaced Cabinet secretary Simon Case after he recused himself from the probe after it was revealed he had known about a Christmas quiz held within his own department). A source also told The Independent there were “more parties” that would come to light if Ms Gray “gets the info she ought to get”. However, they added that it was “deeply wrong” that officials should “get the blame” when their actions were sanctioned by the PM. “He was there for [the parties],” they said. “He encouraged people to drink and drank himself. And it was a clear untruth for No 10 to suggest that there was nothing that could be described as [a party]. It was shocking that they even tried to claim that.” These events, both indoors and outdoors at No 10, took place on several occasions and were “most definitely not work meetings”, they added. Which is interesting because when Mr Johnson did finally address the issue at Prime Minister’s Questions on 12 January, he confirmed that he had attended the garden gathering for around 25 minutes with the intention of thanking his staff for their efforts during the pandemic while claiming, somewhat improbably: “I believed implicitly that it was a work event.” He apologised, expressed empathy for the public fury in light of the personal sacrifices millions had made and implored his critics to await the outcome of Ms Gray’s inquiry before passing judgement. That cut little ice with Labour leader Sir Keir, who described the PM as a “pathetic spectacle of a man who has run out of road” and “without shame”, derided his mea culpa as “worthless” following “months of deceit and deception” and called on him to resign, the seething disdain in his voice drawing chuckles of laughter from across Parliament while members of Mr Johnson’s frontbench sat stoney-faced behind their Covid masks. Subsequently, news of more parties has emerged to add to the total, including two separate events on 16 April 2021, the evening before Prince Philip’s funeral when the Queen sat alone in accordance with strict Covid rules as she bade farewell to her husband of 73 years. Both events are said to have been leaving parties for staff working in the PM’s inner team, with wild tales told of “excessive alcohol” being drunk, attendees dancing to music DJ’d by a special adviser beyond midnight and a staffer being sent out to the local branch of Co-op to fill a suitcase with bottles of wine. As further details were leaked to the newspapers in dribs and drabs, Mr Johnson invited further exasperated ridicule when he told Sky News during a hospital visit on Tuesday 18 January: “I can’t believe we would have gone ahead with an event that people said was against the rules… Nobody warned me it was against the rules, I am categorical about that – I would have remembered that.” Senior official Sue Gray has completed her inquiry into possible rule-breaking parties held in No 10 and elsewhere in government After news of a sixteenth and final party, the aforementioned gathering to celebrate Mr Johnson’s birthday, emerged, the Met announced its investigation, prompting the delay of Ms Gray’s report as Scotland Yard requested that sensitive details pertaining to its own areas of inquiry be removed. We now know that the Met has over 300 photographs and 500 statements collected by the civil servant in its possession. This serialised scandal – following on from Tory sleaze allegations, questions over the awarding of lucrative Covid contracts and inconsistencies in accounts of how the cost of the refurbishment of Mr Johnson’s own flat was met – has continued to garner popular derision, prompting ridicule from comedians and TV personalities and criticism from the opposition, a mood that was only briefly interrupted by concern over the Omicron surge and the arrival of Christmas. When Sir Keir was sidelined in isolation with Covid, his deputy Angela Rayner said the Partygate revelations were “despicable” and that Mr Johnson had “consistently shown that he has no regard for the rules he puts in place for the rest of us”. “At the time this party took place, key workers on the front line were working around the clock to keep us all safe, people suffered loneliness and loss in unimaginably tough circumstances, and for the majority of the country our freedom was limited to a daily walk,” she added. Mr Johnson’s office has since been accused of “hiding behind inquiries” for its pains, repeatedly declining to answer questions and telling critics to wait first for Ms Gray’s inquiry to conclude and now the Met’s.  Many will be understandably outraged by the latest developments, particularly given the brazen contradictions between Mr Johnson’s apparent behaviour and what he had to say at the time. In another Downing Street press conference on the pandemic on 25 May 2020, just five days after the “bring your own booze” party, the PM answered a question from a member of the public on live TV by saying: “Feel free to speak to people to yourself if you feel that they are not obeying the rules. But the police will step in if necessary and encourage people to obey the law.” Mr Johnson does not appear to be ready to step down of his own volition so, unless his own backbenchers do submit the long-threatened letters of no-confidence to Sir Graham Brady’s 1922 Committee in sufficient numbers, the advent of the war in Ukraine and the spectre of local elections on 5 May might just be enough to save his bacon once again. A new YouGov poll has concluded that 57 per cent of the British public believes that he and Mr Sunak should resign, should the PM need any additional food for thought on the subject.

(945, '/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-partygate-timeline-fines-b2064696.html', 1, 'independent', 'Partygate: Timeline of government gatherings', 'Boris Johnson is under intense pressure over Partygate again, after he and his chancellor Rishi Sunak were handed fixed penalty notice fines by the Metropolitan Police. Scotland Yard announced more than 50 fines for government staff members over law-breaking events held at Downing Street and Whitehall during the Covid pandemic. Having initially said in December he was “sickened” at the idea of No 10 staff flouting rules, Mr Johnson found himself forced to admit that he too had attended an event on 20 May 2020. Since then, more damning reports have appeared about further pandemic-era parties allegedly held behind the scenes in Westminster. The Independent looks at all the claims of parties and investigations into gatherings across No 10, government departments and at Conservative Party HQ. 15 May 2020 – No 10 garden gathering A joint investigation by The Independent and The Guardian revealed that a wine and pizza gathering was held in the No 10 rose garden on 15 May 2020 – despite people from different households being restricted to one-on-one meetings outdoors. An image later published showed wine and cheese being consumed by the prime minister, Ms Johnson, and advisers including Dominic Cummings. Former health secretary Matt Hancock was also photographed in the Downing Street garden, after having delivered the day’s covid press conference. Mr Johnson has previously insisted “those people were at work, talking about work”. At the time, Covid laws banned gatherings of more than two people unless they met specific exemptions, such as being “for work purposes”. 20 May 2020 – ‘Bring your own booze’ In a blog post, Mr Cummings, the PM’s former chief adviser, dismissed the idea that the 15 May photograph depicted a party, insisting it was common practice for meetings to be held in the open air of the garden. However, he claimed that a “socially distanced drinks” event did take place on 20 May 2020. The row exploded as a leaked email sent from the PM’s private secretary showed over 100 No 10 staff were invited to the event, told to “bring your own booze”. Mr Johnson subsequently apologised, confirming that he attended the event for around 25 minutes but assumed it was “a work event” – an execuse that drew laughs of incredulity in the Commons and mockery from Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer. This became one of 12 events investigated by the Metropolitan Police as part of the Operation Hillman investigation, after senior civil servant Sue Gray’s interim report looked into claims surrouning 16 events. 18 June 2020 – Cabinet Office leaving do Ms Gray’s interim report said a gathering in the 70 Whitehall building was held to mark the departure of a No 10 private secretary. It is one of the events the police been investigating. The event had not previously been disclosed, but The Telegraph said the official in question is former home affairs policy adviser Hannah Young, who left Downing Street to take up the role of deputy consul general in New York. 19 June 2020 – Boris Johnson’s birthday Downing Street staff allegedly held an afternoon birthday party for Mr Johnson at No 10. His wife, Carrie Johnson, led the surprise gathering where there was cake, a singing of happy birthday, and picnic food from M&S, ITV News reported. A No 10 spokeswoman confirmed that a group of staff had “gathered briefly” in the Cabinet Room “to wish the prime minister a happy birthday”, adding: “He was there for less than 10 minutes.” But No 10 denied a claim that Mr Johnson’s friends and family were hosted upstairs in his flat for an event later that evening. Mr Sunak is said to have received his fixed penalty notice (PFN) fine for attending the birthday party at No 10 Cabinet Room, which is subject to the police probe. 13 November 2020 – Downing Street ‘flat party’ Another allegation made by Mr Cummings was of a “flat party” in Mr Johnson’s official residence on 13 November 2020 – the same day he left No 10. Mr Cummings claimed staff “could hear the music playing loudly”. Asked at PMQs in December whether there had been a party on 13 November 2020, Mr Johnson said “no” but added: “I’m sure that whatever happened the guidance was followed at all times.” This is another of the events which the police is looking into. According to reports at the time, Mr Johnson gave a leaving speech for Lee Cain, his departing director of communications.  New lockdown laws had once again banned gatherings and leaving home “without reasonable excuse” at the time. Indoor gatherings were allowed in some circumstances if “required precautions” were undertaken. 27 November 2020 – Cleo Watson’s leaving event Another leaving event was reported to have been held two weeks later — when the lockdown remained in place — for adviser Cleo Watson, with the PM personally delivering a speech while alcohol was consumed. It was one of the events looked at by Ms Gray, but police chose not to investigate. 10 December 2020 – Education department drinks event Also under scrutiny is a social event reportedly held at the London offices of the Department for Education on 10 December 2020, instigated by the then-education secretary Gavin Williamson to thank his staff. The department admitted a “gathering of colleagues” took place on 10 December, with “drink and snacks brought by those attending”, adding: “Looking back we accept it would have been better not have gathered in this way at that particular time”. The law had changed again, including different levels of restrictions for different areas according to Covid rates. London was in Tier 2, which banned indoor social gatherings unless specific exemptions applied. 14 December 2020 – Shaun Bailey’s Tory HQ do Four days later, with Londoners still subject to Tier 2 restrictions, a party took place at the Conservative Party headquarters in Westminster.  A spokesperson for the party said the event was “authorised” and disciplinary action was was taken against four CCHQ staff seconded to the then London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey’s campaign. The Mirror newspaper later published an image of the gathering — which feature staffers and a catered buffet – leading to the resignation of Mr Bailey from an official role at the London Assembly as chair of the police and crime committee.  15 December 2020 – Christmas quiz The following day, No 10 staff were involved in a festive quiz, with reports suggesting invites were sent out in advance. An image later published by the Sunday Mirror showed the PM flanked by colleagues, with one draped in tinsel and another wearing a Santa hat. Downing Street said the prime minister had “briefly” attended the quiz – after the photographic evidence emerged – but insisted it was a virtual event and claimed he broke no rules. Tier 2 laws remained in force. 16 December 2020 – Transport department drinks event The Mirror reported senior civil servants were “boozing and dancing” at yet another event, this one allegedly planned by staff from transport secretary Grant Shapps’ office. A departmental spokesman said: “Fewer than a dozen staff who were working in the office had a low-key, socially distanced gathering ... where food and drink was consumed. We recognise this was inappropriate and apologise for the error of judgement.” At midnight, London had been moved into tougher Tier 3 restrictions and indoor gatherings remained banned. 17 December 2020 – More No 10 leaving drinks A leaving do was held for a departing Downing Street official. The Telegraph reported that the staff member in question was Captain Steve Higham, then one of Mr Johnson’s private secretaries, who advised on defence and national security issues. The Mirror, which first reported the event, also being probed by the police, and said Mr Johnson was only there “for a few minutes”. 17 December 2020 – Cabinet Office drinks events The former director-general of the Government’s Covid Taskforce, Kate Josephs, said she was “truly sorry” over leaving drinks held in the Cabinet Office. Separately cabinet secretary Simon Case removed himself from the inquiry into Whitehall parties – to be replaced by Ms Gray – after reports emerged of a gathering in the Cabinet Office. Both events have been probed by police. The Cabinet Office said Mr Case played no part in the event “but walked through the team’s office on the way to his own”. Both Cabinet office events are being probed by the police. 18 December 2020 – ‘Christmas party’ that started scandal Allegations of a Christmas party held in No 10 on 18 December 2020 were the focus of much anger at the end of the last year when the reports first emerged in The Mirror.  The event happened while London remained in strict Tier 3 measures, and just a day before Mr Johnson imposed an effective lockdown in the capital and other swathes of the country. Mr Johnson was forced to address the issue in the Commons after the explosive leak of a video showing No 10 staff holding a mock press conference and making jokes about a Christmas party.  It led to the resignation of government aide Allegra Stratton and the PM announcing Ms Gray’s investigation, claiming he was “shocked” by the video. “I apologise unreservedly for the offence that it has caused up,” Mr Johnson told MPs. It’s one of the events being probed by police. 14 January 2021 – More No 10 leaving drinks The police said another one of the 12 events being probed was a gathering was held in No 10 to mark the departure of two private secretaries on 14 January last year. Reports have suggested the PM attended the leaving event, which was for a senior civil servant in the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, according to The Telegraph. The other official’s identity is so far unknown. 16 April 2021 – Leaving drinks on eve of Philip’s funeral Reports of gatherings at No 10 appeared in The Daily Telegraph alleging that two parties took place on the evening of Friday 16 April 2021 – when England was under Step 2 Covid restrictions that banned indoor mixing.  The events, being probed by police, occurred on the evening before Prince Philip’s funeral that saw the Queen sit alone at a socially-distanced ceremony. According to the newspaper, witnesses said that “excessive alcohol” was drunk and attendees danced to music. One point a staffer was allegedly sent to a local Co-op supermarket with a suitcase to with bottles of wine. One event was held for James Slack, the then-director of communications at No 10, who now works as deputy editor-in-chef at The Sun newspaper, and the other for Mr Johnson’s personal photographer. This article was amended on 14 April 2022. It previously said that a photograph showed wine and cheese being consumed by various individuals including Matt Hancock, but the image did not show Mr Hancock eating or drinking.

(946, '/news/uk/politics/angela-rayner-ap-boris-johnson-parliament-london-b2064699.html', 1, 'independent', 'UK women slam sexism of \'Basic Instinct\' slur on lawmaker', ' Women from across British politics called Monday for action to tackle misogyny after a newspaper ran a story accusing the deputy opposition leader of trying to “distract” the prime minister during debates by crossing and uncrossing her legs. The Mail on Sunday quoted an anonymous Conservative lawmaker as saying Labour Party Deputy Leader Angela Rayner tried to throw Prime Minister Boris Johnson “off his stride” as she sat across from him in the House of Commons. The article likened it to a scene in the 1992 thriller “Basic Instinct” in which Sharon Stone is interrogated by police. Rayner accused “Boris Johnson’s cheerleaders” of using “desperate, perverted smears.\" “I stand accused of a ‘ploy’ to “distract” the helpless PM - by being a woman, having legs and wearing clothes,” she wrote on Twitter.  “Women in politics face sexism and misogyny every day — and I’m no different.” Rayner, who comes from a working-class family in northern England and left school when she was 16, makes a sharp contrast to Johnson, who was educated at the elite private school Eton and Oxford University. Johnson has sometimes struggled to parry her attacks during debates. The prime minister condemned the article, writing on Twitter: “As much as I disagree with Angela Rayner on almost every political issue I respect her as a parliamentarian and deplore the misogyny directed at her anonymously today.” Technology Minister Chris Philp said \"nobody should have to suffer the kind of misogynistic abuse that sentiment amounts to.” He told Sky News that the anonymous lawmaker in the article would be disciplined if identified. More than a century after the first female lawmaker was elected to Britain’s Parliament, women make up 34% of the 650 legislators in the House of Commons. Long known for its boozy, macho atmosphere, Parliament is now a more diverse place.  Some say change has not gone far enough. Many female politicians said the article was an extreme example of the sexism they encounter daily. “I hope that some good can come out of this awful article in The Mail on Sunday, and that is that people see what it is like in Parliament and people call out this misogyny and sexism for what it is and that we get some change because Angela and no other MP should have to put up with this sort of rubbish,” said Labour legislator Rachel Reeves. Senior Conservatives also condemned the remarks. Health Secretary Sajid Javid tweeted: “No woman in politics should have to put up with this.” Conservative lawmaker Caroline Nokes, who heads Parliament’s Women and Equalities Committee, said she had asked the Speaker of the House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, to censure Glen Owen, the journalist who wrote the article.

(947, '/news/uk/politics/angela-rayner-boris-johnson-dorries-article-b2064635.html', 1, 'independent', '‘Nothing surprising’ in ministers using same words to support Rayner', 'A government minister has insisted there is “nothing surprising” about Boris Johnson and the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, using identical words in tweets expressing support with Angela Rayner. The comments from the culture minister, Chris Philp, came as politicians of all stripes condemned the misogynistic claims made about Labour’s deputy leader by an unidentified Conservative MP in the Mail on Sunday. Ms Rayner labelled the story “desperate” and “perverted” after it quoted an anonymous MP claiming she crossed and uncrossed her legs in the Commons to distract Mr Johnson during prime minister’s questions. Asked about the article on Sky News, Mr Philp said he was “appalled by the sentiment was being expressed”, and said he would be “disgusted” if he heard any colleagues expressing similar views. “The prime minister and cabinet ministers have been absolutely right to roundly condemn that sentiment, to offer support to Angela Rayner on this issue,” he said. Mr Philp’s, however, insisted it was not surprising that both the prime minister as Ms Dorries, the culture secretary, used exactly the same words in tweets they posted denouncing the claims. “As much as I disagree with Angela Rayner on almost every political issue I respect her as a parliamentarian and deplore the misogyny directed at her anonymously today,” both Mr Johnson and Ms Dorries tweeted. Asked about the messages, Mr Philp said: “They share the same view. Nadine’s my boss and she feels very strongly about the place of women in politics and this sort of abuse is unacceptable. “I’m sure she’ll have discussed it with the prime minister and reached the same view and they’ve used the same words,” he added. “There’s nothing surprising for two colleagues in government to have exactly the same view and use the same words”. He also said that if the anonymous MP who spoke to the Mail on Sunday was identified, “I imagine they would be subject to discipline”. But he avoided questions on whether there should be an internal probe by Conservative Party whips. Last night, Mr Johnson was also reported to have wrote to Ms Rayner to insist that “misogynistic” claims about her conduct were “not in his name”, while the party’s chairman, Oliver Dowden, described them as “ludicrous”. In response to the article on Sunday, Labour’s deputy leader tweeted: “Women in politics face sexism and misogyny every day – and I’m no different.” She added: “Boris Johnson’s cheerleaders have resorted to spreading desperate, perverted smears in their doomed attempts to save his skin. They know exactly what they are doing. The lies they are telling. “The potted biography is given – my comprehensive education, my experience as a care worker, my family, my class, my background. The implication is clear.” “I won’t be letting their vile lies deter me. Their attempts to harass and intimidate me will fail. I’ve been open about how I’ve had to struggle to get where I am today.  “I’m proud of my background, I’m proud of who I am and where I’m from - but it’s taken time.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(948, '/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-angela-rayner-basic-instinct-b2064631.html', 1, 'independent', 'PM writes to Rayner to say ‘Basic Instinct’ claim was not in his name', 'Boris Johnson has written to Angela Rayner to insist “misogynistic” claims reportedly made about her by an unidentified Tory MP were not in his name. According to the Daily Telegraph, the prime minister sent the deputy Labour leader a letter on Sunday in response to a report in the Mail on Sunday which has been condemned by Tory and Labour MPs alike. Mr Johnson reportedly moved to assure Ms Rayner in the private letter that the comments were “not in his name”, expressing his sympathy over the anonymous attack. The article claimed that an unnamed Tory MP had told the newspaper Ms Rayner crossed and uncrossed her legs on the Labour front bench during Prime Minister’s Questions in an attempt to distract Mr Johnson. Angela Rayner in the Commons  The paper likened the claims to a scene from the 1992 erotic thriller Basic Instinct and said she was trying to put the PM “off his stride”. On Sunday, Ms Rayner called the story “desperate” and “perverted” and quickly received solidarity from across the House of Commons for the “smear”. The prime minister was among those to publicly condemn the claims on Twitter. “As much as I disagree with (Ms) Rayner on almost every political issue I respect her as a parliamentarian and deplore the misogyny directed at her anonymously today,” he wrote. Senior ministers followed suit in condemning the claims. While Treasury minister Simon Clarke retweeted Mr Johnson’s message, culture secretary Nadine Dorries posted the same tweet as the PM. On Sunday evening, the Tory chairman of Parliament’s Women and Equalities Committee, Caroline Nokes, revealed she had written to Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons Speaker, to suggest the journalist who wrote the story be formally censured. The Conservative MP for Romsey and Southampton North told LBC the Tory MP sources behind the article should be “hanging their heads in shame”. Earlier in the day she wrote on Twitter that “too many female MPs (of all parties)” have been on the “receiving end of vile” claims like those aimed at Ms Rayner. Ms Rayner often sits next to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and opposite the prime minister during the weekly Commons clashes. She has also stood in for Sir Keir at PMQs when he has been forced to self-isolate due to Covid-19. In a series of tweets, Ms Rayner lashed out at the “lies” being briefed about her. The Ashton-under-Lyne MP said: “Boris Johnson’s cheerleaders have resorted to spreading desperate, perverted smears in their doomed attempts to save his skin. “They know exactly what they are doing. The lies they are telling.” She said Mr Johnson and his backers “clearly have a big problem with women in public life” and that they “should be ashamed of themselves”. “I won’t be letting their vile lies deter me. Their attempts to harass and intimidate me will fail,” Ms Rayner added. Sir Keir said the sexism displayed by those briefing the Sunday paper was a “disgraceful new low from a party mired in scandal and chaos”. Tulip Siddiq, the shadow economic secretary to the Treasury, said the accusations were “disgraceful”. The Labour politician told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge On Sunday: “At the end of the day, Angela Rayner is an MP who was elected on merit. “To talk about the fact she is using her legs or her posture to manipulate the Prime Minister is ridiculous and I’m really upset about it.” One Tory MP is said to have told the paper: “She (Ms Rayner) knows she can’t compete with Boris’s Oxford Union debating training, but she has other skills which he lacks. “She has admitted as much when enjoying drinks with us on the (Commons) terrace.” Andrea Leadsom, the former leader of the Commons, similarly called the comments “totally unacceptable” and expressed sympathy for the deputy Labour leader. When asked on Sophy Ridge about the coverage, Tory chairman Oliver Dowden said he did not recognise the claims attributed to his party’s MPs. Health Secretary Sajid Javid tweeted: “If an MP or MPs really said this then it’s utterly shameful. “No woman in politics should have to put up with this.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(949, '/travel/news-and-advice/covid-travel-restrictions-travel-select-committee-b2064411.html', 1, 'independent', 'Covid travel rules were ‘disproportionate and confusing’, say MPs', 'Travel restrictions that were “disproportionate to the risks to public health” and caused severe damage to the UK’s aviation industry, the Transport Select Committee has said. In a wide-ranging and highly critical report, MPs say the government’s frequently changing Covid-19 rules “were not based on scientific consensus”.  The report states that the measures caused “a severe financial shock to the sector”, without significant health benefits. But the government insists the travel restrictions “were in place for no longer than absolutely necessary”. Soon after the start of the coronavirus pandemic, in mid-March 2020, the UK was unique in dropping all arrival restrictions. But by June of that year, as other countries were opening up, ministers went the opposite extreme with a mandatory quarantine of 14 days for all arrivals to the UK (except from Ireland). Frequent short-notice changes, coupled with the introduction of hotel quarantine and an incoherent system of “traffic light” restrictions continued for the following 21 months. All travel measures were eventually removed in March 2022. The committee, chaired by the senior Conservative MP Huw Merriman, is scathing about the measures imposed by the transport secretary, Grant Shapps. “The way in which the government introduced international travel restrictions during the pandemic was inconsistent, confusing industry and passengers,” it concluded. “The aviation industry, which connects the UK to the world, experienced severe economic difficulties due to government restrictions that were not based on scientific consensus.” Traffic light restrictions are described as “opaque, ambiguous and inconsistent”.  The report says “the rationale behind decision-making on the classification of individual countries as ‘red’, ‘amber’ or ‘green’ was not made available”. On hotel quarantine, the MPs find “no evidence” of any benefit compared with self-isolation at home. They also deplored the frequent changes in rules, saying: “Restrictions changed more than 15 times between 2020 and 2022.” In fact, if the many “traffic light” moves are included, changes run into the hundreds. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport rejected the committee’s findings, saying: “Our priority was protecting public health, and these measures bought vital time for the rollout of our successful booster programme as we responded to new and concerning variants. “But we also ensured they were in place for no longer than absolutely necessary, and the UK was the first country in the G7 to remove all travel restrictions. “In future, the government’s default approach will be to use the least stringent measures, to minimise the impact on travel as far as possible and these will only be implemented in extreme circumstances.” Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, said: “The sector has been through its worst-ever crisis and it will take several years to deal with the debt airlines had to take on to make it through the pandemic with no passengers.” Britain’s pre-eminence in European aviation has been lost. For decades up to the start of 2020, London Heathrow was the busiest in Europe. But the UK’s main hub began 2022 in 10th place, according to Airports Council International, behind both main airports in Moscow, the two Istanbul airports and even the resort of Antalya in Turkey.

(950, '/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-liar-speaker-commons-parliament-b2062420.html', 1, 'independent', 'MPs allowed by Speaker to call Boris Johnson a ‘liar’ in parliament', 'The Speaker of the House of Commons has permitted MPs to call Boris Johnson a \"liar\" during a parliamentary debate, breaking with recent convention. The unusual step comes as parliament discusses whether the prime minister should face a standards probe for his conduct during the Partygate scandal – and over whether he misled parliament. MPs are banned from using unparliamentary language in the chamber, which normally includes referring to other MPs as liars.  Speaker Lindsay Hoyle has sanctioned MPs for referring to the prime minister as a liar a number of times in recent months, ejecting SNP chief Ian Blackford from the Chamber in January and Labour MP Dawn Butler last summer.  But on Thursday he appeared to temporarily lift the ban, allowing Scottish national party MP Mr Blackford to repeatedly call Mr Johnson a liar. \"Not only were parties happening, not only was the law broken, the prime minister was at the very parties he denied had even happened! The truth is simple and it\'s this: he lied to avoid getting caught,\" Mr Blackford said in his contribution to the debate. \"And once he got caught, he lied again. There is no other way to describe it. There is no other word for it.\" SNP Westminster chief Ian Blackford He added: \"This is about the behaviour of a prime minister, and office, and much more importantly, the uncomfortable truth that the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom as a liar is exactly why they finally need to act and remove him from office.\" As Mr Blackford told MPs again \"that the prime minister of the United Kingdom is a liar\" and that this was \"so obviously true\" there were murmurs of discontent from the government benches but no intervention from the Speaker It comes after the prime minister was fined for attending a lockdown birthday birthday. The prime minister had initially claimed parties did not happen in Downing Street and then claimed he was furious to discover they had happened. Clarifying the situation with language, the Speaker told MPs later in Mr Blackford\'s contribution: \"It is about the terms of what we are debating.\" PA Reuters PA PA PA AFP/Getty PA PA PA Getty PA PA AFP via Getty PA AFP/Getty PA PA PA PA AFP/Getty PA Reuters PA AP SWNS PA Getty PA PA PA PA AFP/Getty AFP/Getty PA PA PA PA AFP/Getty PA PA PA PA PA PA PA AFP via Getty Images UK PARLIAMENT/AFP via Getty Images PA PA AP Reading from a statement at the beginning of the debate on whether to refer Boris Johnson to the privileges committee for contempt of parliament, the Speaker Sir Lindsay had said: \"While it is perfectly in order for the honourable members to question the veracity of the prime minister\'s responses to the House cited ion the motion it is not in order to challenge more generally the truthfulness of the prime minister or any other honourable member. Good temper must be maintained in parliamentary language.\" Polling suggests the public agree that the prime minister lied about partygate: YouGov found that 78 per cent per cent of voters think he has lied about the episode, including 61 per cent of 2019 Tory voters and 51 per cent of those still saying they would vote Tory. Meanwhile a survey by pollster JLPartners released at the weekend found that the prime minister is widely regarded as a “liar” more generally by the public, with the term the most cited when a representative sample of voters were asked to describe him.

(951, '/climate-change/net-zero-climate-boris-johnson-b2064371.html', 1, 'independent', 'Ditch ‘net zero’ commitment and lose 1.3 million votes, Johnson warned', 'The Conservatives will lose 1.3 million votes if they water down the commitment to achieve net zero carbon emissions, Boris Johnson is being warned. A poll carried out by Onward, a think tank close to the party, has found much stronger support for sticking to the 2050 policy than abandoning it, even as the economic clouds darken. It comes as a powerful group of backbench Tories, including former ministers Steve Baker and Esther McVey, put pressure on Mr Johnson to accept the costs to voters of net zero are too high. They want to slam the brakes on CO2-cutting moves to replace gas boilers and insulate homes – which have already been condemned as feeble by many experts. Last month, the Conservative chair Oliver Dowden attacked “net zero dogma”, as he insisted new drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea must go ahead. Oliver Dowden has been critical of ‘net zero dogma’ But Will Tanner, Onward’s director and a former No 10 adviser to Theresa May, said its research showed voters will “punish any party” that reneges on the landmark net zero pledge. It found that two in every five people who voted Conservative at the 2019 general election would be less likely to back the party again if it abandons its commitment to reach net zero by 2050. Only 18 per cent of former Conservative voters said they would return to the party after such a U-turn – which would cost the Tories up to 1.3 million voters, the think tank estimated. And support for net zero is higher among northern Conservative voters than southern Tories, suggesting many of the crucial Red Wall seats snatched in 2019 would be put at risk. “It is not only untrue to say that the Conservative party’s electoral prospects are undermined by a commitment to net zero, but the opposite of reality,” Mr Tanner said. Boris Johnson with his wife Carrie “Voters overwhelmingly back action to protect the environment, support the deadline that parliament introduced ... and will punish any party that reneges on those promises. “This is as true, or truer, for the Conservative party’s new coalition as for its old guard.” Mr Johnson has insisted he will not scrap green levies on energy bills, to pay for clean energy investments, after briefing that the move is being considered. The poll also found that 55 per cent of all voters believe the war in Ukraine is a reason to press ahead with net zero targets, while just 28 per cent want the UK to slow down. Overall, almost two-thirds of voters support net zero policies while just 9 per cent oppose them – and 58 per cent agreed that “even if it’s going to be expensive, we need to stop damaging the environment”. Rachel Wolf, founder of Public First, which carried out the poll, said: “It is striking that, even in the midst of a terrifying cost-of-living squeeze, voters from different social backgrounds want politicians to stay the course on green policies.” Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}}  By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

(952, '/news/uk/politics/rishi-sunak-labour-non-dom-tax-break-b2063919.html', 1, 'independent', 'Labour pledges to scrap non-dom tax break after Sunak’s wife status', 'The next Labour government would scrap the non-dom status used by rich individuals to cut their tax bills, the party has told The Independent. The decision comes after The Independent revealed that Rishi Sunak’s wife, wealthy businesswoman Akshata Murty, had used non-domicile status to minimise her UK tax bill and unveiled alleged links between Mr Sunak and offshore trusts.  The chancellor, as well as most cabinet ministers, have declined to comment on whether they directly, or indirectly, benefitted from non-dom status or the use of tax havens. Labour’s shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said: “As the Tories raise taxes on working people, it simply isn’t right that those at the top can benefit from outdated non-dom tax perks. “With Labour, people who make the UK their home will contribute to this country by paying tax on their global income.” Rachel Reeves says the wealthy should not benefit from ‘non-dom tax perks’  Labour’s shift to remove non-dom status adds to pressure on the government over the mounting cost of living crisis and the Partygate scandal which threatened to overshadow the prime minister’s trip to India last week, ahead of British local elections in May. Ms Reeves said: “The prime minister and chancellor have spent the last few weeks preoccupied with saving their own skins, and have done nothing to tackle the spiralling cost of living. “Even worse, they’ve made it harder for working people to make ends meet by hiking national insurance.” The opposition party has also announced that it will now review the use of trusts hidden offshore and in tax havens to avoid paying tax in the UK, as part of a broader examination of the British tax system started in September last year. Labour decided it would scrap non-dom status because it failed a value for money test, as the party claims it likely costs more in lost income to the exchequer than it generates. It would replace non-dom tax status with a mechanism similar to those in Germany or Canada which also allows temporary residents to avoid domestic tax on overseas earnings.  “This would be a clear, simple, and modern system, ending the 200-year-old rules we currently follow that mean domicile is passed down through people’s fathers, with no need for the four complicated flowcharts the HMRC use to determine someone’s domicile,” a spokesperson for the Labour party said. The government’s current policy is a “bizarre disincentive on UK investment,” Dan Neidle, a tax lawyer at Clifford Chance said on Twitter. He believes that scrapping the special status would generate hundreds of millions of pounds in new tax revenue. Four in 10 individuals who earned more than £5m or more in 2018 claimed non-dom status at some point, academics at the London School of Economics and Warwick University found in a recent study. It has been a live policy issue in recent years, with a conditional 15-year limit placed on the tax break introduced in 2017.  However, if a non-dom creates an overseas trust before their status lapses, they can still benefit from the tax break via that trust once the 15-year limit is reached. This is one reason why Labour has also announced it will review the use of offshore tax havens and trusts. Mr Sunak, as chancellor, is responsible for setting UK tax policy. He has referred his financial disclosures for review by the independent adviser on ministerial interests, Lord Geidt. After a spokesperson initially defended her use of non-dom tax status break, Ms Murty announced she would no longer use non-dom status on her tax return. However, she did not give up the ability to use it in areas such as inheritance tax. In a statement posted on Twitter earlier this month, Mr Sunak said: “I have always followed the rules and I hope such a review will provide further clarity.” A source close to the chancellor said they do not recognise allegations and documents seen by The Independent which showed Mr Sunak was listed as a beneficiary of off-shore tax havens in 2020. Some senior Treasury officials have claimed they offered advice on decisions that were relevant to non-dom status and tax havens, but were not informed of the chancellor’s links to these issues. However, sources close to Mr Sunak said that the most senior figures in the Treasury were aware of the issue, so as to manage any potential conflicts of interest. The former chancellor and current health secretary, Sajid Javid, issued a statement confirming he had also used non-dom status, after The Independent revealed Ms Murty’s use of the tax break. In response to Labour’s new policy announcement, a HM Treasury spokesperson said: “We want to attract talent to work and live in the UK, however it is only right that those who choose to live here for a long time pay their fair share of tax, which is why we reformed the rules in 2017 to end permanent non-dom status. “Non-doms play an important role in funding our public services through their tax contributions – worth over £6 billion a year.” Labour’s review of the use of trusts and tax havens will also examine how to extend beneficial ownership registers and tax reporting regimes “to provide transparency around offshore trusts”. It will also try to force the government to confirm the full extent of offshore trust and how much this costs the state, by limiting the scope of UK taxes, a spokesperson said.
